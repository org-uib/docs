                        <p>Bergen, the second-largest city in Norway, experienced a large outbreak of giardiasis in the autumn of 2004. Around 1300 individuals had a laboratory confirmed diagnosis, but it is estimated that 5-6 000 people were infected with the parasite Giardia lamblia. The outbreak was caused by faecal contamination of Svartediket, one of the cities main water supplies.</p>

                        <p>This event provided the impetus for various studies, including research on the outbreak dynamics, genotypes of Giardia lamblia, and the diagnostic value of laboratory tests. As some people did not fully recover from their giardiasis infections, further research efforts have concentrated upon a large group of patients who suffered long-term effects following Giardia infection.</p>

                        <p>BGRG (Bergen Giardia Research Group) is a network of scientists who collaborate in various studies associated with the giardiasis outbreak in Bergen. In this website we will provide information for the general public and other scientists about the research projects with which we are involved.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <div class="content-frame">
                    <p>It is estimated that between 5000-6000 persons in Bergen were infected with the parasite <em>Giardia lamblia</em> during autumn 2004, due to drinking contaminated water from an open municipal water source, Svartediket. The parasite was detected in faecal samples from around 1300 individuals.</p>

                    <p>Whilst some of the infected individuals did not develop symptoms and others had mild illness, many of those infected developed considerable abdominal symptoms of nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, foul smelling flatulence, and bloating. An excess of around 2500 prescriptions of anti-parasitic treatment were issued by primary care physicians during the epidemic. For many of the patients the prescribed treatment resulted in a cessation of symptoms.</p>

                    <p>However, some patients did not recover, despite treatment and effective eradication of the parasite, sometimes after several treatment courses. Around 200 patients have been referred to the medical department of Haukeland University Hospital in the three years following the outbreak. These patients have been thoroughly evaluated and followed up in order to reveal any specific serious/treatable illness causing their symptoms.</p>

                    <p>The abdominal symptoms observed, are consistent with a group of illnesses termed functional gastrointestinal diseases (FGID) which, among others, encompasses functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A subgroup of patients have experienced severe physical and mental fatigue as the most prominent and debilitating symptom. Some of these patients have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).</p>

                    <h3>Duodenal immune responses in chronic giardiasis and mechanisms for development of post-infectious functional gastrointestinal disorders</h3>
                    <p>In many of the referred patients with persistent abdominal symptoms an unexpectedly high frequency of intestinal inflammation was found. Studies of duodenal biopsies from these patients and healthy controls are being performed to evaluate the involvement of T and B-cells in this inflammatory process.</p>

                    <h3>Prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders and chronic fatigue 3, 6 and 10 years after the Giardia epidemic</h3>
                    <p>Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome and post-infectious chronic fatigue syndrome have been reported following infections with several agents. These studies investigate the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders according to the Rome III criteria, and chronic fatigue according to a Fatigue Questionnaire in 1250 patients with confirmed diagnosis of giardiasis and an age and sex matched control-group. Additionally, we have investigated whether atopic disease, overactive bladder syndrome, subjective food intolerance and sleep is associated with the post-infectious symptoms observed.</p>

                    <h3>Metronidazole resistance in Giardia</h3>
                    <p>Clinical resistance against the commonly used drug metronidazole is increasing in Giardia, especially in travellers form the Indian subcontinent. Through collection of clinical isolates and genetic characterization of clinically susceptible and resistant strains we are looking for markers and mechanisms of metronidazole resistance in Giardia. We also perform functional characterization of proteins involved in the metronidazole metabolism and oxidative/nitrosative stress regulation pathways.</p>

                    <h3>Giardia vaccine targets</h3>
                    <p>We have been examining the genetic variation in Giardia vaccine targets alfa-1-giardin and Cyst wall protein 2. Further work includes characterising human immune responses to these proteins.</p>
