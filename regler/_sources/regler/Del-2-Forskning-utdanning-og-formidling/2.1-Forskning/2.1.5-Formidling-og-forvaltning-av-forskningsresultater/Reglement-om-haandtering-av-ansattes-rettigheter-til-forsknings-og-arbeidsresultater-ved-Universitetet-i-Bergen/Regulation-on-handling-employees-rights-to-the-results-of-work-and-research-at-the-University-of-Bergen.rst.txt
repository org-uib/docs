Regulation on handling employees' rights to the results of work and research at the University of Bergen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Background**

Changes in the Norwegian Act relating to Universities and University
Colleges in 2002 entailed assigning institutions the mandatory task of
contributing towards research-based innovation and creativity, in
addition to their primary tasks of research, teaching and dissemination
of information. Moreover, there are increasing expectations that
research results, in addition to application for purely academic
purposes, shall also be utilized for commercial ends. This has
actualized the issue of who has the right to use research and work
results: it is necessary to clarify rights ownership policy and to
design legislation to regulate the question of rights to intellectual
property.

The University Board adopted the “Rights Policy at the University of
Bergen” in June 2009 (agenda item 68/09) The rights policy provides a
general framework for handling the issue of rights ownership linked with
various categories of research-based work results. The present
regulation is rooted in rights policy and provides supplementary
provisions for the handling of intellectual property rights pertaining
to research and work results.

**Purpose**

| The purpose of this regulation is to clarify the extent of the
  university’s right to use or exploit research and work results
  produced by university employees. The the regulation governing the
  handling intellectual property rights shall contribute towards:
| • ensuring that researchers and institutions’ academic freedom is
  supported and safeguarded
| • increasing awareness of the importance of the values that research
  results represent
| • raising awareness of the meaning of safeguarding and protecting the
  research results that are produced
| • creating unambiguous and predictable frameworks for internal and
  external collaborative partners
| • increasing the opportunities for efficient and expedient
  exploitation of research results in academia, society and business
  life.

**Point of departure**

In general, the person who creates a result out of research or work is
the owner of the rights to the result unless otherwise established by
provisions pursuant to statutes, contract or this regulation. The rules
herein regulate the cases in which the university, as the employer, has
ownership rights to these research- and work-related results.

If the university enters into agreements with a third party concerning
collaboration on research or research funding, including contributory
and contracted work, the employee who participates in such projects must
conform with any property rights dispositions laid down in such
agreements.

In cases where the university has such rights, the institution must see
to it that the results are used in the best interests of society. This
can be through commercialization or making the results publicly
available wherever possible.

**Whom does the regulation encompass?**

The guidelines apply for all employees of UoB.

Students own the results they generate from their studies or stay at the
university, unless otherwise agreed. Upon request from the student, and
if the university finds it expedient after the results have been
evaluated for commercial potential by Bergen Teknologioverføring AS (BTO
- technology transfer), the university can transfer the innovation
rights for commercial exploitation. In this voluntary transfer of rights
for commercialization, the distribution of rights is regulated by a
separate agreement between the student-innovator and the university via
BTO. In the case of results that are produced by one or more students
and one or more employees together (joint ownership), the university has
the right to take control of the employees’ share of the co-owned IPR,
in accordance with legislation, any existing agreements and the present
regulation. Students who are employed at the university, for example in
a project position or as a research assistant, are subject to the same
treatment as any other employees in terms of results derived from tasks
performed as part of their work duties under the terms of the employment
contract.

For guest researchers, the question of intellectual property rights
should be clarified by separate agreement.

If an employee has more than one employer, the employers must come to a
consensus as to how their rights are to be divided among themselves.

**What does the regulation encompass?**

The present regulation applies only to results achieved in conjunction
with the employee’s contractual employment at the university. Although
the regulation encompasses all research and work results, this does not
mean that the university will demand control of all rights to results.

| Research and work results can generally be grouped in the following
  categories (the list is not exhaustive):
| • Non-fictional productions (such as monographs, textbooks, scientific
  articles and doctoral theses) and other literary and artistic works
| • Teaching and communications materials (such as oral lectures,
  different types of presentations, written assignments, instructional
  videos and digital teaching programmes)
| • Computer programs
| • Catalogues and databases (designing of various systematized
  collections of information or data)
| • Inventions
| • Physical materials – all material products (organic, non-organic and
  biological materials) – including substances, organisms, cultivated
  growths and materials
| • Administrative works (such as fact-finding reports, consultative
  statements, proposed curriculum/syllabus and teaching plans)

**Further information on the handling of rights to various results**

| *Non-fictional works*
| As a rule, the employees themselves can decide what can be done with
  their own non-fictional works (such as copying, storage, alteration
  and publication of monographs, textbooks, academic articles and
  doctoral theses) In specially justified cases, the university may
  obtain a non-exclusive, limited right to use such rights. This applies
  particularly in cases where the university has spent or is investing
  significant resources in developing the materials. The issue of
  whether the university is to have such rights must be clarified in
  advance.

| *Other literature and works of art*
| As a rule, the employees themselves can decide what can be done (such
  as copying, storage, alteration and publication) with their own
  literary production or works of art. In specially justified cases, the
  university may obtain a non-exclusive, limited right to use such
  results. This applies particularly in cases where the university has
  spent or is investing significant resources in developing these.. (The
  issue of whether the university is to have such rights must be
  clarified in advance.

| *Teaching and communication materials*
| As a rule, the employees themselves can decide what can be done (such
  as copying, storage, alteration and publication) with their own
  teaching and communication materials.

| The university has the right to use such materials if:
| • they are designed for general use (standardized materials)
| • the university has contributed dedicated developmental support in
  the form of financing, technical assistance or reduced teaching duties
| • the university has specially asked an employee to develop these
  teaching materials
| • the university has entered into an agreement with a third party
  specifically commissioning the materials for use in teaching
| • such use is either agreed with the developer of the materials or
  authorized in some other way

| Terms and conditions for university’s right of use:
| • The right of use shall not extend any further than can be justified
  by the university based on the university’s mandates
| • The right of use shall not obstruct the employee’s own right of use
| • The employee shall have the right to be notified of any changes
| • The employee retains his/her ideal protection right (the right to be
  credited by name)

| *Computer programs*
| The university has the right to computer software that is designed by
  an employee through the work tasks that are encompassed by terms of
  employment or under assignment from the university. The right shall
  not extend any further than what can be justified as the university's
  primary tasks (research, teaching and dissemination of information).
  Furthermore, the university’s right shall not obstruct the employee’s
  own right of use, for example, the use of open software licences (open
  source).

| *Catalogues and databases*
| The university has sole rights to use (copy, store, alter and publish)
  catalogues and databases that have been created through substantial
  investment on the part of the university. Execution of sole rights
  shall not conflict with the principle of academic freedom or be a
  hindrance to making catalogues and databases publicly accessible or
  otherwise be placed at disposal for research purposes. For other
  catalogues and databases, the sole rights belong to the employee who
  produced them, unless
| • the university has specially asked an employee to develop these
  catalogues or database
| • the university has entered into an agreement with a third party
  specifically commissioning the materials
| • otherwise formally agreed

| *Inventions*
| The university can demand to take over commercial rights to the
  employee’s patentable inventions, in whole or in part. The use of this
  right shall not conflict with the principle of academic freedom. The
  employee is free to prioritize publication, even if this may hinder
  the opportunity to commercialize the invention. Any postponement for
  the purpose of safeguarding the rights (for example, sending in the
  application for a patent) can be agreed. An employee who develops and
  invention must provide written notification to Bergen
  Teknologioverføring AS (BTO), cf. Section 5, Norwegian Act Respecting
  the Right to Employees’ Inventions. If there is a wish to make the
  invention known to the public, this must be included in the
  notification. Reference is also made to the section below pertaining
  to General provisions concerning commercialization of research and
  work results.

| *Physical materials*
| Physical materials produced through the use of university resources
  are the property of the university and can be freely used by the
  university for teaching, research and commercial purposes. This does
  not apply, however, if an agreement with a third party or other’s
  rights stand in the way of this.

| The person who has produced the material has
| • The right to access and use for his/her lifetime and has the right
  to
| • Share the material with others (including outside the university)
  under the following conditions:
| 1. some of the material must remain at the university, that is, the
  source cannot normally be deleted;
| 2. the recipient shall not transfer the material to a third party
  without the consent of the university;
| 3. physical objects may only be shared with others for research
  purposes; sharing for commercial purposes requires a separate
  agreement;
| 4. A signed agreement on the use of the shared material must be
  obtained (the university’s template for Material Transfer Agreement)
  from the recipient before the material is dispatched.

| *Administrative works*
| The university has all rights to administrative work (such as
  fact-finding reports, consultation statements, curriculum/syllabus
  proposals and teaching plans).

**General provisions concerning commercialization of research and work
results**

Commercialization activities shall not conflict with the principle of
academic freedom. The employee is free to prioritize and opt making the
result known to the public even though this may conflict with
opportunities to commercialize. Bergen Teknologioverføring AS (BTO) is
the university’s commercialization agent and administrator in the
interests of the university, cf. agreement and decision of the
University Board nos.101/04 and 67/06 respectively.

| All employees are encouraged to contact BTO if they have concepts and
  results that may have the potential for commercialization, cf.
  www.bergento.no. Pursuant to the Employee Invention Act, employees
  have a duty to report inventions; it is BTO that is the recipient of
  such reports on behalf of the university. Pursuant to the Norwegian
  Copyright Act, it may also be mandatory to report computer software
  programs and databases. Examples of other results that can be reported
  are physical objects as well as ideas with a potential to be
  commercialized, along with results that can be copyrighted, such as
  trademarks and designs.
| BTO will evaluate whether an effort is to be made to commercialize
  results. The evaluation is done in dialogue with the employee. The
  employee briefs his/her department head on the case in question when
  the commercialization process begins.

The employee has a right to a reasonable share of the net revenue from a
successful commercialization. The benchmark for revenue sharing is
one-third to the employee, one-third to the university and one third to
the research environment in which the commercializable result was
achieved.

In the event the university does not exploit a research result or pursue
commercialization of it by a given deadline, the employee
himself/herself may exploit the result commercially by agreement with
the university.
