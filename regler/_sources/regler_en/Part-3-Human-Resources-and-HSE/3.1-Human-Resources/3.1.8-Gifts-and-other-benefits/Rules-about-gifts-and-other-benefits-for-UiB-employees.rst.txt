Approved by the University Board in a meeting on 14 February 2008.

Section 1. General rules for the acceptance of gifts and other benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| UiB employees must not accept gifts or other benefits for themselves
  or others that can be used to, or that the giftor intends to, affect
  their actions in the service of UiB, or that otherwise violate laws,
  regulations, ethical guidelines or other rules applicable to UiB
  employees.
| "Gifts and other benefits" means, for instance, goods, services,
  commissions, tickets to events, travel, hotel bookings, food or
  coverage of expenses.
| Money or valuables that correspond to money, such as loans and rebates
  etc., must never be accepted.
| Special care must be taken when gifts and other benefits are offered
  in connection with negotiations, the entering or completion of
  agreements, etc. If anyone receives an offer that can be understood as
  undue influence or an attempt to unduly influence, the offer must be
  rejected and must be reported to the immediate supervisor.

Section 2. Rules for recipients of gifts and other benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| UiB employees may accept gifts or other benefits valued at up to NOK
  300 provided this does not violate the general rules in section 1.
| If anyone has accepted a gift or other advantage valued above NOK 300,
  the recipient must submit the gift to their immediate supervisor for
  evaluation. Gift or other benefits must also be submitted if there is
  doubt about their value.

Section 3. Senior supervisor's processing of submitted gifts and other benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The senior supervisor may permit a recipient to retain gifts and other
  benefits valued at up to NOK 1,000 if this is considered negligible in
  relation to the employee's performance of the work, or if it cannot
  harm UiB's interests. In other cases, the gift must be returned to the
  giftor with reference to UiB's rules about gifts.
| Gifts received in connection with representation for UiB must be given
  to the University Director if valued at more than NOK 3,000. The gift
  can otherwise be kept by the unit of the person who has represented
  UiB and received the gift.
| If an offered or accepted gift or benefit violates the general rules
  in section 1, the University Director must be notified. Received gifts
  shall be returned to the giftor with reference to UiB's rules about
  gifts.

Section 4. Invitations to dinners, social events, etc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Social business events such as dinners, events, etc. paid by suppliers
  or other partners can take place to a limited extent and their
  frequency, degree and value must be reasonably proportionate to
  business requirements. Such business-related socialising must in no
  case be suitable to affect decision-making processes or harm UiB's
  interests.
| Invitations to such social events must be submitted to the immediate
  supervisor, who must decide whether to permit participation.

Section 5. Travel etc. in the service of UiB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| When suppliers or other partners offer travel to visit factories, to
  courses, conferences, etc., UiB shall as a general rule cover expenses
  for travel, accommodation and per diem costs.
| If the employee is to make professional contributions or the like in
  connection with the trip, travel expenses may be covered in accordance
  with applicable customs.
| Travel must always be approved by a senior supervisor.

Section 6. Private use of framework agreements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Framework agreements entered with UiB's suppliers about the supply of
goods and services cannot be used privately by UiB employees for
themselves or their associates, unless the framework agreement contains
explicit general rebates etc. for all UiB employees.

Section 7. Offer of gifts or other benefits from UiB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UiB employees shall not give or offer gifts or other benefits that can
be used to or are intended to influence the recipient's professional or
business actions etc.

Section 8. Violations of the rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Violations of the rules can lead to sanctions such as disciplinary
measures or dismissal, and may form the basis for prosecution.
