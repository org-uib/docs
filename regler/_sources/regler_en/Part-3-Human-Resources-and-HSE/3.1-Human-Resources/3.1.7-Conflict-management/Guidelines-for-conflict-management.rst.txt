Guidelines for conflict management
----------------------------------

:doc:`Norwegian version </regler/Del-3-Personal-og-HMS/3.1-Personalforvaltning/3.1.7-Konflikthaandtering/Retningslinje-for-konflikthaandtering>`

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In any working environment, disagreements may arise between employees
about academic and administrative issues, as well as about the exercise
of the employer's management prerogative. Such disagreements are also
part of the working environment at UiB, and will not normally in
themselves imply that there is a conflict situation.

In a good working environment, there should be a low threshold for
presenting unbiased and constructive criticism. Employees at UiB should
be able to express themselves about problematic and conflicting
circumstances in the organization and be confident that these are
followed up and managed in a good way.

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

A conflict is a situation where two people, one person and one group or
two groups feel that they are being prevented or frustrated by the
other.\ `[1] <https://regler.app.uib.no/regler/null>`__

Prevention
~~~~~~~~~~

It is expected that all UiB employees by their conduct contribute to
preventing conflicts from occurring in their own working environment.
This is done, among other things, by participating in the organised
safety and environmental work in the organization and actively
contributing to the implementation of the measures that are initiated to
create a good and safe working environment.

Scope
~~~~~

UiB has the overall responsibility for a fully satisfactory working
environment, including conflict management.

The guideline is intended as an aid for the manager to deal with
conflicts between two or more employees. This includes conflicts between
colleagues, between employees and managers and between managers.

In the event of conflicts between employees and others, reference is
made to the students' Si fra (Speak Out) system and guidelines for
dealing with violence and threats.

An employee who becomes aware of a conflict he himself is not involved
in, or abusive behaviour in general, may choose to blow the whistle on
this according to UiB’s guidelines for notification (whistle blowing)

Conflicts caused by what one or more employees believe to be misconduct
in research are handled according to special rules.

Notify of conflict situations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Employees who experience being a party to a conflict that they
themselves are unable to handle must notify their immediate supervisor
with personnel responsibilities or a senior manager.

Notification can also be given via a safety representative or an
employee representative. When the safety representative has notified the
employer, the safety representative shall hand over the specific
handling of the case to the employer. Both manager and employee can
contact the Occupational Health Service (BHT). The employer shall also
ensure that the occupational health service assists if necessary. BHT
has a duty of confidentiality, as well as a free and independent role in
working environment cases.

Handling
~~~~~~~~

When a manager becomes aware of a conflict, he/she shall immediately
seek to obtain an overview of the case and ensure a proper
administrative procedure. The administrative procedure shall be
documented in writing.

As far as possible, the manager must check that he/she is not a party to
the conflict. In such a case, the case should be dealt with at the
senior management level.

The manager may seek advice and assistance on handling the conflict from
the HR department and/or the Occupational Health Service.

Investigation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It will often be natural to initiate the investigation by individual
interviews with the involved parties and others who may be able to shed
light on the case.

Some advice regarding the interviews:

-  Inform the involved parties of their right to include an employee
   representative/adviser in the invitation to a meeting. At the same
   time, inform who the employer has requested to attend the meeting
-  Start by clarifying the purpose and premises of the interview
-  Be prepared for the fact that such interviews may be emotionally
   distressing for the employee
-  Do not be biased. Be concerned with listening to your employees.
   Avoid being influenced by the first information you receive.
   Different versions can be equally correct/wrong
-  Make a memo from the interviews. To avoid any misunderstandings, the
   employee should be allowed to review and, if necessary, revise the
   memos from their interviews
-  Trust and confidentiality are particularly important in such
   contexts. When disseminating information received, one should avoid
   referring to who has said what, but focus on what was communicated

After the interviews, a summary of the case must be prepared and it must
be considered whether further information retrieval is needed in order
to investigate the case.

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

When the manager believes the case has been enlightened as well as
possible, a conclusion should be reached as to how the case should be
handled further or what measures are necessary to ensure a fully
satisfactory working environment. The involved parties should be
informed of the conclusion.

Follow-up
~~~~~~~~~

The further handling of the conflict does not always involve a duty of
activity for the employer in relation to restoring a satisfactory
working environment. In some cases, it is sufficient with a
clarification to the person(s) involved that they must abide by the
employer's instructions even if they disagree with them. In other cases,
arbitration may be most appropriate, whereas in some cases it must be
conveyed to the employee(s) that the situation is of such a character
that must be accepted in a working relationship.

However, cases that are categorised as 'improper conduct' are not
subject to arbitration or as anything that an employee must accept
within the employment relationship. In such cases, there should always
be a reaction towards the person(s) who is responsible for the improper
conduct.

If the manager concludes that it is necessary to take measures to ensure
a fully satisfactory working environment, the parties involved shall be
given an account of what measures will be implemented and be informed of
the progress plan for when this is planned to be Implemented.

In some cases, it may be appropriate to use external conflict advice
from a consulting firm or similar.

The safety delegate shall be informed of the handling of conflict cases
that they have reported.

If the manager's conclusion implies that one or more employees should be
subject to formal sanctions, this shall be done in accordance with
applicable rules. Before implementing such a process, the HR Division
should be consulted.

In order to prevent the conflict situation from arising again, the
manager must continue to follow up the conflict case. This must be done
even if the conflict case has apparently resolved itself in a
straightforward way.

Lack of handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Failure to deal with conflicts may be notified as censurable conditions
according to UiB’s guidelines for notification (whistle blowing)
