**Regulations for appointments to academic positions and academic/administrative management positions**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adopted by the University Board on 28 May 2014

**1. Scope of application for the regulations**
-----------------------------------------------

The regulations apply to the University of Bergen (UiB) for all
appointments to teaching and researcher positions, fixed-term positions
and appointments having particular conditions of employment, which are
regulated according to, or in compliance with, the provisions of the
Norwegian Act relating to Universities and University Colleges.

Moreover, the regulations apply to existing provisions in other formal
governing documents, such as statutes, regulations, key agreements or
the staff regulations for the University of Bergen, and other internal
rules and guidelines.

**2. Overarching recruitment principles**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The qualification principle shall form the basis for appointments to
UiB. The best qualified applicant shall be hired for the vacant
position, unless exceptions are made in law or regulation. In assessing
who is best qualified, emphasis should be placed on education,
experience and personal suitability, compared with the eligibility
requirements set out in the announcement, cf. The Norwegian Civil
Service Act Section 3 (1) and (2).

For positions based on academic qualifications, academic production and
the academic level must meet established international or national
standards. When creative or performing artistic qualifications form an
essential element of the competence requirement, artistic practice or
development work of a high international level is required. Academic and
artistic qualifications shall be assessed by means of an expert
assessment according to requirements listed in the announcement and job
description.

Educational competence must be documented in accordance with the
requirements set out in the regulations and the criteria established by
UiB.

There must be active, focused, and systematic efforts to achieve gender
equality in all job categories.

teaching and research positions, as well as positions as department head
and head of the base unit.

A calling proposed by the University administration should occur, as a
rule, on the advice of the faculty board on the basis of clear and
unambiguous recommendations from the department and faculty.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

3.3.1 Delegation of authority
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Board may delegate its decision-making authority to subordinate
bodies or one or more appointment bodies to the extent that it is not
stipulated by law that the Board itself must make the decision, or there
are other special restraints in terms of delegating authority.

All decisions at the institution made by authorised persons other than
the Board members must be made on the basis of delegation from the Board
and at the Board’s responsibility.

3.3.2 Execution of delegated authority
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The nomination- and appointment bodies which have received
decision-making authority by delegation from the Board are considered to

The faculty board can delegate to the dean the task of advertising jobs
and appointing an expert assessment committee in those cases where the
faculty board has the authority to appoint.

The Department Head establishes a group that will collaborate on
conducting interviews, gathering references and arranging trial
lectures. The composition of the group and the work itself must be

positions.

Within its scope of authority, the faculty board can decide which cases
concerning appointments are to be decided by the board, with the
exception of those positions where the faculty board cannot delegate the
authority to appoint.

For appointments to permanent academic positions, the appointments board
shall consist of the dean and four members who are departing from the
faculty board: a permanent employee in a teaching and research position,
a temporary employee in a teaching and research position, a technical or
administrative employee and a student. Deputies are those elected or
appointed as deputies for the members of the faculty board.

For employment in temporary academic positions, the appointments board
shall have the dean as leader and four members. Two of the members shall
represent the employer, one member the public service trade union and
one member the students. Personal deputies are appointed for the
chairperson and members.

The dean posts the position and appoints an expert assessment committee
in cases where the appointments board has the authority to make
appointments.

The department dead of basic units associated with the faculty sets up a
group that will collaborate on conducting interviews, gathering
references and arranging trial lectures. The composition of the group
and the work itself must be adapted to the objective of efficient and

prerequisite that sufficient academic, educational and/or artistic
qualifications have been documented for the position.

Under no circumstances may the stipulated period for an administrative
appointment be exceeded.

4.3.2 When the nature of the work so requires, lecturers, assistant
teachers, practice teachers, hourly teachers and practice supervisors

**6. General procedural rules for appointments**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**6.1 Announcement**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

6.1.1 As a rule, vacant positions must be publicly advertised.
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The appointment boards have the authority to post vacant teaching and
research positions. Announcements shall take place in compliance with
government and internal guidelines.

Before an announcement is made, the appointing authority, or whoever has
been delegated such authority, shall check that the announcement text
and job description:

- are in conformity with the unit's research and recruitment strategy

- have sufficient coverage in budgets

- are worded such that the announcement text along with the job
  description provide the necessary framework for the appointment process
  and can be integrated as a part of the employment agreement

- have statutory authority permitting appointment to temporary positions

- are in conformity with the law and the collective agreement

- contain a special invitation to apply if one gender is clearly
  under-represented in the applicable job category in the specific subject
  area

- are sent to the chief employee representative at UiB as information on
  the salary for the position being posted, and concerning the expiry of
  the comment period of three days.

6.1.2 Preparation of the announcement text
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The professional requirements and description of the vacant position are
drawn up in collaboration with the academic environment in which the
position will be placed. The administration must quality assure the
standard parts of the announcement text which will form part of the
employment agreement together with the job description, and which are
important to ensure compliance with statutes and the collective
agreement.

The application deadline is normally 3 weeks.

6.1.3 Renewed announcement
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Qualification criteria set out in the announcement text and the job
description cannot be waived upon appointment to the position. The
position should be announced again if you wish to change the eligibility
requirements.

If no eligible applicants have applied for the position, the appointment
may not take place until after a new announcement has been made.

6.1.4 Exemption from announcement
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Announcement may be avoided for administrative positions as mentioned in
Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2, and for appointments to externally financed
assignments according to Section 7.3.

6.1.5 Access to the list of applicants and expanded list of applicants
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

As soon as the application deadline has expired, a complete list of
applicants must be made public, in compliance with the Norwegian Freedom
of Information Act. The list must include, for each applicant, name,
age, position or professional title and municipality of residence or
municipality in which the applicant works.

Requests on the part of the applicants to be exempted from public
disclosure on the list of applicants shall be subject to a specific
assessment on a case-by-case basis.

An applicant has the right to inspect the expanded list of applicants.
This must contain all of the other applicants' names and age and
complete information relevant to their education and practical
experience in public and private sector activity, cf. the Norwegian
Public Administration Act.

**6.2 Expert assessment**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

6.2.1 The expert assessment's function in the appointment process
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Academic, educational and artistic qualifications shall be assessed by
means of an expert assessment according to requirements listed in the
announcement and job description. The requirement for expert assessment
is pursuant to the need for independent, professional evaluation and
quality assurance, while at the same time it underscores professional
autonomy as a fundamental element in research, teaching and
dissemination.

6.2.2 Appointment of expert committee
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The appointment of the expert committee and the issuance of the mandate
shall be executed by the specified authority.

The expert committee shall consist of at least three members.

The committee shall be composed so that it has the competency to assess
all applicants who meet the conditions of the announcement and job
description. Both genders must be represented in the expert committee,
unless it can be justified that such representation is not possible. In
the evaluation of applicants for professorial and associate professor
positions, only one of the experts may be employed by UiB. In relevant
subject areas and as far as possible, there should be at least one
expert from abroad. For other teaching or research positions, at least
one expert should be employed outside of UiB.

For the expert assessment of applicants for professorial positions, the
experts must have professorial competence or equivalent competence in
key areas of the discipline. For associate professor positions, at least
one of the experts must have professorial competence, and the others
competence at least at the associate professor level or equivalent
competence within key areas of the discipline.

For other teaching or research positions, postdoctoral positions and
fellowships, experts are appointed with professorial competence, or
competence at associate professor level, depending on the academic level
of the position. For appointment to a position as an associate professor
without requirement for a doctorate, up to two members of the committee
may hold a position as an associate professor. In special cases, a
post-doctoral fellow with expertise in key areas of the relevant
discipline may be used. Post-doctoral fellows with no required duties
may not be used. See also the special procedural rules for both PhD
positions (points 6.2.6 and 7.4) and post-doctoral positions (point
7.5).

In addition to the ordinary experts, in special cases one or more
special experts may be appointed to assess parts of the material
submitted by the applicants. Such special experts will submit individual
assessments as guidance for the ordinary experts.

The experts must not be related to or have such a connection to the
applicants that they will be rendered disqualified under the rules of
the Norwegian Public Administration Act. Similarly, there must be no
other special circumstances which are likely to undermine confidence in
the experts' impartiality; for instance, due regard shall be paid to
whether the expert assessment could entail any special advantage, loss
or inconvenience for the expert or anyone with whom the expert has a
close personal association.

6.2.3 Mandate for the expert committee
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

On the basis of the material submitted and the documented circumstances,
the expert committee will undertake assessment of:

- The applicants' academic and/or artistic qualifications in accordance
  with established international or national standards, and in relation to
  the academic and/or artistic qualification requirements for the vacant
  position as specified in the announcement text and job description.

- Educational competence according to the requirements set out in the
  regulations and the criteria established by UiB for the vacant post, as
  specified in the announcement text and job description.

- Other documented professional qualifications on the basis of the
  requirements specified in the announcement text and job description.

The assessment must state who is qualified, and must describe the
academic distance between the qualified candidates, in addition to
ranking them. For appointment to a position as an associate professor,
applicants shall be assessed, but not ranked, on whether they meet the
requirements for a basic level of educational competence.

The assessment must be most extensive for the best-qualified applicants.
The assessment and ranking shall take into account the time span over
which the results have been achieved, and place most emphasis on
recently achieved results. For ordinary professor and associate
professor positions, academic qualifications will, unless otherwise
stated, be accorded weight ahead of other qualifications. Educational
qualifications will, unless otherwise stated in the announcement text,
be accorded higher weight than qualifications within the areas of
dissemination, administration and management.

If the announcement text is open for temporary employment in the
qualifying position with a view to qualification and permanent
employment, the expert committee shall express an opinion as to whether
the applicants have the academic capability to gain the necessary
qualifications within the stipulated period of temporary employment.

The committee must not express an opinion on issues of equality,
preferential rights, personal capability, or other conditions that do
not concern the applicants' overall documented academic qualifications.

The experts shall normally work as a committee, but in some cases it may
be decided that the experts shall submit individual assessments. If
there is dissent within the committee, the reasons for this shall be
included in the statement.

The expert assessment must normally be ready within three months of the
expert committee's receiving the necessary material, etc. If the
assessment cannot be delivered within this deadline, this should be
reported to the faculty and substantiated.

6.2.4 Applicant's right to submit comments to the expert assessment
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The assessment committee’s evaluation will be sent to the applicant as
soon as it becomes available. The experts’ assessment cannot be
appealed, but the applicant may object to the proceedings or submit
comments on the committee’s assessment within two weeks of the
assessment having been sent to the applicant. Comments to the experts’
assessment shall be submitted to the assessment committee for any
supplementary statement before the expert assessment, comments, and any
additional statement is sent to the nominating authority.

6.2.5 Access to the expert assessment and annotations
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The University practices granting of extended access to inspect the
expert assessment and annotations and/or supplementary statements when
these are forwarded to the nominating authority.

6.2.6 Waiver of the requirement to an expert assessment
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Faculty Board may decide to waiver the requirement to an expert
assessment for PhD candidates, research assistants and residents.

When the requirement to an expert assessment is waived, the nominating
authority must assess whether or not the applicants meet the
requirements relating to basic education and whether they possess
sufficient academic competence to enter the doctoral programme or the
plan/course for specialist training to which the appointment applies.

**6.3 Nominations**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

6.3.1 Nominating authority and ranking
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The nominating committee or the person authorised to nominate submits
the nomination.

If there are three or more qualified applicants for a position, at least
three qualified applicants shall be recommended in the order they ought
to be considered. If there are two qualified applicants, both should be
recommended.

When choosing between applicants who are almost equally well qualified,
emphasis shall be placed on gender equality in the recommendation if one
gender is clearly under-represented in the job category of the
discipline concerned.

6.3.2 Basis and evaluation criteria for recommendations
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The nomination is based on an academic evaluation according to the
requirements listed in the job posting and job description.

Interviews, the gathering of references, trial lectures or other tests
must also be conducted as a basis for the recommendation. The department
head or immediate supervisor of the position shall take part in
interviews. For trial lectures or other tests, the same arbiter shall
participate.

If any of the qualified applicants for a position state that they have a
disability that will require adaptation of the workplace or work
conditions, at least one of these applicants shall be called in for
interview, cf. Regulations of the Civil Service Act Section 6 (1).

According to civil service personnel policy guidelines, at least one
applicant with an immigrant background shall be called in for interview.
This is conditional on the applicant being eligible for the position.
This applies preferably for immigrants from Europe other than EU/EFTA,
Asia (incl. Turkey), Africa, South- and Central America and Oceania
except Australia and New Zealand.

The recommendation must include an assessment of the applicant's
personal suitability for the position. This suitability assessment for
the position in question will necessarily be based largely on subjective
discretion. If personal suitability as a criterion is to be attributed
decisive weight in the ranking of otherwise qualified applicants, the
nominating authority must ensure that this has a justifiable, factual
basis for evaluation. This entails that an interview must be conducted
and that references must be gathered. In addition, the reasons must be
made clear in the recommendation as to why an otherwise well-qualified
applicant's personal suitability is deemed to be inferior to that of
other applicants. In any case, this criterion must be sufficiently
elucidated. Personal qualities that are given weight must be relevant to
the work that is to be performed.

For positions demanding educational qualifications, a separate
assessment is to be conducted as to whether the applicants fulfil these
requirements.

6.3.3 Formulation of the recommendation
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The recommendation must be a written statement of the applicant's
educational background, academic and other formal qualifications, work
experience and personal suitability for the position based on:

- requirements stated in the announcement and job description

- information provided in the applications

- the statement from the expert committee and any appurtenant comments

- information from the interview, references, trial lectures or other
  tests etc.

The recommendation shall also contain comments concerning any special
circumstances that have emerged during the appointment procedure and
that may be significant when considering the candidate for appointment.

If there are applicants who have preferential rights to employment in
the civil service, cf. Civil Service Act Section 24, failure to
recommend these must be specifically justified.

6.3.4 Right of access to the recommendation
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Pursuant to the Norwegian Public Administration Act, applicants have the
right to information concerning the person(s) who have been recommended
for the position and the sequence in which these are ranked in the
recommendation. An applicant also has the right to seek information as
to whether there is any dissent among the members of the nominating
authority, and if so, how many votes each of the recommended candidates
received.

An applicant is not entitled to inspect the document containing the
rationale that the nominating authority has submitted as the basis for
the nomination. This does not apply, however, to the parts containing
new factual information or statements of significance to the case.

In addition to the recommendation, an applicant has the right of access
to inspect parts of the reports from interviews, trial lectures etc.,
pursuant to Section 18 of the Norwegian Public Administration Act.

A copy of the recommendation and the statement of the expert assessor(s)
is sent to the UiB's Equal Opportunities Committee, and the latter has
an opportunity to make comments within 3 working days. The statement of
the committee must accompany the case documents sent to the appointing
body.

The purpose of the Committee is to promote genuine equality at the
University of Bergen regardless of gender, ethnicity, national origin,
colour, language, religion and world views, political views,
organisational affiliation, sexual orientation, functional ability, age
and other conditions.

When a petition is received for public access to information,
unrestricted public access must be specifically considered. When
information subject to mandatory confidentiality is concerned, open
public access is never a practicable option.

**6.4 Appointment**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

6.4.1 The appointing body's supervisory function
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Appointment is made on the basis of the recommendation. The appointing
body must assess whether or not the recommendation is built on a
defensible, factual foundation based on the qualification criteria and
needs presented in the announcement text and job description, the expert
assessor(s) report and personal suitability etc.

If a member of a selection board wishes to employ an applicant who has
not been recommended, a written assessment of the applicant shall be
obtained from the person making the recommendation, cf. Civil Service
Act Section 6 (3). The selection board may then choose to employ one of
those who have been recommended or an applicant on whom they have
obtained a written assessment.

If an applicant with an external preferential right fulfils the
professional and personal requirements for the position, that person
should be employed, unless the exclusions in the Regulations of the
Civil Service Act Section 8 apply. The preferential right does not
apply, inter alia, for employment in positions as professor, docent,
associate professor or senior lecturer, unless the employee has been
terminated from such a position.

If the appointing body is in doubt as to whether the expert assessor(s)'
judgement is adequate and defensible, the appointing body shall do
whatever is necessary to clarify and, where appropriate, correct the
dissension, but shall not itself undertake an expert assessment. The
appointing body can do this through the following procedure:

- request a supplementary statement from the expert committee

- nominate a committee to review the assessment itself to ascertain
  whether it is built on a proper assessment norm

- nominate additional expert assessors or establish a new expert
  committee

6.4.2 Application of the principle of qualification
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The appointing body shall appoint the applicant who is best qualified
for the vacant position.

When choosing between applicants who are almost equally well qualified,
emphasis shall be placed on gender equality in the recommendation if one
gender is clearly under-represented in the job category of the
discipline concerned.

An applicant with a disability may be employed if the person is
approximately as well qualified as the best qualified applicant, cf.
Regulations of the Civil Service Act Section 6 (2).

Qualification criteria set out in the announcement text and the job
description cannot be waived upon appointment to the position.

6.4.3 Administrative procedure in the appointing body
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Appointments to the University Board and Faculty Board are determined in
meetings. The same applies where the faculty has established an
appointments board for permanent academic positions.

Appointment to the appointments board for temporary academic positions
takes place by case documents being sent to the members of the
appointments board, and each member submits a separate statement of
opinion. Finally, the chairperson of the appointments board submits
his/her statement. A meeting is held when one member of the appointments
board so requires, or when there is dissent among the members of the
appointments board.

Members of the appointing body who have participated in the nominating
authority's consideration of the case or who have been members of the
expert committee should relinquish their seats in the appointing body
during the appointing body's consideration of the case.

The appointing body has a quorum when at least half of the members are
present, participate and sign the minutes. When there is parity of
votes, the appointing body’s chairperson has a double vote.

The appointing body's formal decisions are recorded in the minutes,
where it should be shown how the individual members voted. The members
have an opportunity to have their objections/points of view put on
record in the minutes. The objection must be put on record before the
appointing body has finished considering the case in a formal meeting.

The selection board may decide that a trial period should not apply, or
be shorter than six months, when the employee is already employed at
UiB. The same applies when the work in the new position does not differ
materially from the previous civil service position.

6.4.4 Access to inspect the selection board’s assessments and decisions
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The selection board’s decisions constitute public information.

An applicant does not have the right to be informed about those parts of
a document that contain assessments that have been made or issued by the
selection board.

**7. Special regulations for conditions pertaining to appointment to academic positions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**7.1 Temporary additional/part-time posts at UiB**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Temporary appointments may be made to secondary posts up to 20 per cent
of a full teaching and/or research position.

Appointments for a fixed term, secondary post may be made. The
fixed-term appointments can range from two to six years. No limitation
has been placed on the number of times a person can be appointed to a
secondary post on a fixed-term basis.

One prerequisite for appointment to a secondary post at UiB is that the
appointee is primarily in the employ of an employer with whom UiB wishes
to collaborate.

An expert assessment must be conducted according to the job description
that is adapted to the academic, educational and/or artistic competence
required for the temporary position. In special cases, the Faculty Board
may decide that the requirement to an expert assessment may be waived.
For employees in temporary secondary posts at UiB who have achieved
competence certification for an II-position and who are applying for a
vacant full-time position, a new assessment must be undertaken focusing
on the ordinary academic, educational and/or artistic qualifications
required for the vacant position.

The secondary post expires according to the termination reasons that
apply for the position in question, irrespective of whether the primary
position has expired or not. Extension or a new fixed-term period is not
applicable if the employee no longer holds a primary position with
another employer with whom UiB wishes to collaborate.

**7.2 Combined positions**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A combined position is a permanent primary position and a permanent
secondary post of up to 20 per cent of a full-time position that,
according to an agreement between different employers, are linked
together in such a way that the employee who holds the primary position
is also required to have the secondary post. Combined positions differ
from other job combinations in that the secondary post is treated as a
supplement to the employee's main salary and is not included in the
overall job percentage.

The agreement should clarify the employers’ obligations in terms of
employees in combined positions, and adaptation and financing of the
research- and teaching functions that employees in combined positions
are expected to attend to. Provisions are to be made for adapting each
of the work conditions so that work duties in both positions are
attended to.

Combined positions must be advertised at the same time and jointly by
the primary and secondary employers.

Applicants must fulfil the employment conditions and competence
requirements for both positions. In special cases, the Faculty Board can
decide that the requirements to an ordinary expert assessment for
secondary posts at UiB may be waived. For employees in secondary posts
at UiB who have achieved limited competence certification and are
applying for a different permanent position or promotion, a new
assessment must be conducted focusing on the ordinary academic,
educational and/or artistic qualifications that are required.

If one employer wishes to appoint an applicant that the other employer
does not find to be qualified, the position is advertised again. Prior
to appointment to the primary position, the selection board for the
secondary post must approve the appointment.

Employees in combined positions shall observe both parties’ rules
regarding safeguarding of confidential information.

Applications for/notification of holiday leave, illness and other
absence must be submitted to both employers.

Upon expiry of employment in the primary position, employment in the
secondary post also expires. Independent termination of the secondary
post takes place in conformity with the regular rules on termination in
the secondary employer's organisation.

Pension conditions for combined positions must be clarified individually
with the Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund.

**7.3 Externally financed assignments**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

7.3.1 According to the provisions of the Civil Service Act Section 3
(3), exemptions may be made from the Civil Service Act Section 3 to
Section 7 for the employment of personnel who are to perform externally
financed assignments.

Externally-financed personnel are employees who are hired to perform
assignments that are fully or mainly financed by revenue recognition of
funds from another source. In order for financing to be called external,
the funds must be transferred from a source that is not in such a
relationship with UiB that it would be natural to consider the financing
as internal. Financing of assignments via its own Ministry is not
regarded as external financing. However, the transfer of funds from
another Ministry would be considered external financing. The employee is
paid from assignment funds transferred from another source. If UiB
accepts a portion of the expenses of the assignment out of self-interest
or as support, this will not affect the assessment if UiB's own
contribution is limited or immaterial.

The work must essentially apply to the assignment to be performed.
Therefore, the employee should not perform regular, ongoing work tasks.

In the case of UiB, the possibilities for exceptions to the regulation
for externally financed assignments should be practiced as follows:

7.3.2 Eligibility principle and announcement
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Exceptions may be made to the announcement and competition for
externally financed positions in cases where specific individuals are
required to perform the work. This may be natural based on the project
application or it may be a condition by the client that specific
individuals should participate in the project, for example.

7.3.3 Recommendation and employment
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Where a speedy hiring process is needed, the Faculty Board may decide
that the requirements to expert assessment may be waived. The
recommending authority must assess whether the candidate is sufficiently
professionally competent to perform the duties in the externally
financed position.

Appointments to positions in externally financed assignments may be made
by the appointments board.

**7.4 Research fellowship positions**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Research fellowships are fixed-term positions to which appointments are
made in accordance with the Norwegian Act relating to Universities and
University Colleges and the regulations relating to conditions of
employment for the position.

The Dean can delegate the task of appointing an expert committee to the
department head. The committee must comprise at least two experts. Both
genders must be represented in the committee, unless it can be justified
that such representation is not possible.

The department head establishes a group that will collaborate on
conducting interviews, gathering references and arranging trial
lectures. The composition of the group and the work itself must be
adapted to the objective of efficient and proper administrative
processing with respect to the posted job, number of applicants etc.
Members of the Expert Committee may also be among the members of this
group.

The nominating authority submits the recommendation.

Appointments to post-doctoral positions may be made by the appointments
board, cf. Point 4.2.

**7.5 Post-doctoral research positions**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Post-doctoral positions are fixed-term positions to which appointments
are made in accordance with the Norwegian Act relating to Universities
and University Colleges and the regulations relating to employment
conditions for the position.

The Dean can delegate the task of appointing an expert committee to the
department head. The committee must comprise at least three experts.
Both genders must be represented in the committee, unless it can be
justified that such representation is not possible.

The department head establishes a group that will collaborate on
conducting interviews, gathering references and arranging trial
lectures. The composition of the group and the work itself must be
adapted to the objective of efficient and proper administrative
processing with respect to the posted job, number of applicants etc.
Members of the Expert Committee may also be among the members of this
group.

The recommendation is submitted by the nominating authority.

Appointments to post-doctoral fellow positions may be made by the
appointments board, cf. Point 4.2.

**8. Resignation, termination, suspension or disciplinary action, cf. Norwegian Act relating to Universities and University Colleges, Section 11-3**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**8.1. Decision-making body**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The appointments body itself decides the case under the Civil Service
Act Section 30 (1) on dismissal, termination, suspension or disciplinary
action.

For positions for which the appointments board is the appointing body,
such cases are decided by the Faculty Board.

**8.2 Appeals body**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Employees who have been dismissed, summarily discharged, suspended or
have had disciplinary sanctions imposed on them can appeal the decision
to the University Board.

If the decision is adopted by the University Board, the Ministry is the
appeals authority.
