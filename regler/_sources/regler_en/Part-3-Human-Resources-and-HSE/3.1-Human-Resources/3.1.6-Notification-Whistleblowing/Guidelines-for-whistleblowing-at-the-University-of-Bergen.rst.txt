Approved by the University Director on 30 november 2020.

**Introduction**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a good working environment, there is a low threshold for presenting
unbiased and constructive criticism. It is therefore important that
employees of the University of Bergen feel confident that they can
express themselves regarding problematic circumstances in the
organization and that these will be handled and followed up in a good
way. The guidelines for reporting censurable conditions are intended to
encourage an open culture characterized by good internal communication.

**1) Purpose**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The guidelines have been drawn up to facilitate internal whistleblowing
in accordance with `Section 2 A-6 of the Norwegian Working Environment
Act <https://lovdata.no/lov/2005-06-17-62/%C2%A72a-6>`__ . In addition,
the guidelines are intended to clarify procedures, obligations and
rights in connection with whistleblowing.

It is an objective that the working environment at UiB should be
characterised by transparency and good internal communication. The
whistleblowing guidelines are intended to uncover or prevent censurable
conditions at UiB. It is desirable, and in the best interests of the
organization,that UiB's employees make use of their right to blow the
whistle on censurable conditions.

**2) Scope**
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The guidelines apply to anyone who performs work for UiB, including
temporary employees hired from employment agencies. Other groups, such
as students and persons in labour market training, are considered as
employees when they perform work for UiB, cf. `Section 1-6 (1) of the
Working Environment
Act <https://lovdata.no/lov/2005-06-17-62/%C2%A71-6>`__.

The guidelines are applicable in cases where the employee blows the
whistle according to the duty of notification in `Section 2-3 of the
Working Environment
Act <http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-20050617-062-002.html#2-3>`__, or the
notification provision in `Section 2 A-1 of the Working Environment
Act <http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-20050617-062-002.html#2-4>`__.

Students' complaints concerning the learning environment are handled in
accordance with `Section 10-3 of the University and University Colleges
Act. <https://lovdata.no/lov/2024-03-08-9/§10-3>`__ (Norwegian only)

**3) Duty of notification – Section 2-3 of the Working Environment Act**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Employees are obliged to notify the employer of conditions in the
workplace that relate to errors or deficiencies that entail danger to
life or health, or if someone is injured or incurs illness that the
employee believes is a result of conditions in the workplace, cf.
`Working Environment Act Section 2-3 no. 2, b) and
e) <https://lovdata.no/lov/2005-06-17-62/%C2%A72-3>`__. The notification
shall be given in accordance with `Guidelines for notification and
follow-up of health, safety and environment
deviations <../../../../regler/Del-3-Personal-og-HMS/3.2-Helse-miljoe-og-sikkerhet/3.2.3-HMS-retningslinjer/Retningslinjer-for-melding-av-avvik-ulykker-og-nestenulykker.html>`__
as soon as the employee has become aware of the circumstance.

Notification of harassment or discrimination in the workplace shall be
given in accordance with the guidelines for whistleblowing, as soon as
the employee becomes aware of the circumstance, cf. `Working Environment
Act Section 2-3 no. 2,
d) <http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-20050617-062-002.html#2-3>`__.

State employees have an obligation to notify their employer concerning
circumstances that they become aware of and which may inflict loss or
damage on the employer, employees or the environment so that measures
can be initiated with a view to avoiding or limiting the loss or damage,
cf. `The Code of Conduct for the Civil Service section
2.2 <http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/fad/dok/Veiledninger_og_brosjyrer/2005/Etiske-retningslinjer-for-statstjenesten.html?id=88164>`__.

The safety representative has a special duty of notification under
`Section 6-2 (3) of the Working Environment
Act <http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-20050617-062-006.html#6-2>`__.

**4) Right to blow the whistle - censurable conditions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Employees have the right to blow the whistle on censurable conditions in
the organization. Censurable conditions means conditions that are in
conflict with the rule of law, written code of conduct or ethical norms
to which there is a broad acceptance in society, such as circumstances
that may involve

a) danger to life or health

b) danger to climate or the environment

c) corruption or other economic crime

d) abuse of authority

e) irresponsible working environment

f) breach of personal data security.

Statements on circumstances concerning only the employee's own working
conditions are not considered as whistleblowing, unless the circumstance
is covered by the points mentioned above.

**5) Procedure for whistleblowing of censurable conditions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**5.1) Internal notification**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At UiB, an `electronic notification form <https://digiforms.uib.no/tjeneste/Varsel/en>`__ has been prepared that employees
can use when notifying censurable conditions. If the employee does not wish
to use the electronic notification form, it can be notified to the immediate
line manager or to another senior manager. The notification is considered to
have been received by UiB as the employer when the notification has been sent
via the electronic notification form or given to such notification recipient.

It can otherwise be notified via a safety representative, employee representative,
colleague, lawyer or similar to a notification recipient.

It is always prudent to notify in accordance with the duty of notification or 
UiB’s guidelines.

Internal notification is not considered as prudent if the censurable conditions
are taken up in an inappropriate manner that unnecessarily harms the co-operation
climate, the working environment or individuals in the organization, for example
by repeated baseless allegations aimed at colleagues.

The notification may be submitted in writing or orally, by phone or email or in
person. The notification should include the full name, the whistleblower’s place
of work and the conditions to which the notification applies and should be as 
exhaustive as possible to ensure the best possible follow-up.

Anonymous notification is allowed.

**5.2) External whistleblowing**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The employee can always notify externally to a public supervisory
authority or other public authority.

When notifying the media or the public in general, stricter requirements
are placed on the whistleblower and the procedure. Such whistleblowing
can be made if

a) the employee is in good faith concerning the contents of the
   notification,

b) the notification relates to censurable conditions that are of public
   interest, and

c) the employee has first blown the whistle internally, or has reason to
   believe that internal whistleblowing will not be appropriate.

Confidentiality requirements may limit the right to notify externally,
cf. `Section 13 of the Public Administration
Act <http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19670210-000-003.html#13>`__.

**5.3) Burden of proof for proper procedure**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The employer has the burden of proof that notification has been made in
breach of this provision.

**6) Administrative procedure for whistleblowing of censurable conditions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The University Director by the HR Director is the recipient of the electronic
notification forms. Other notification recipients must immediately forward received
notification to the University Director by the HR director.

The HR Director is responsible to record a notification journal. Recording of the
notification journal is important for later documentation and for ensuring a good
follow-up of the notification. In the notification journal, the content of the 
notification must be recorded and further incidents and conversations in the case
documented, see form templates for the notification journal.

The HR Director appoints, in accordance with the University Director, a lawyer at
the Division of Human Resources as responsible for the case processing of the 
individual notification. The following general principles apply when handling 
notification cases, cf. the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation's 
guidelines for the preparation of local notification procedures in the Norwegian State;   

- all enquiries should be taken seriously

- all enquiries should be addressed immediately

- it should be ensured that the case is as well informed as possible

- anonymous sources can be worth as much as open sources

- the different whistleblowing methods should be valued equally

- confidential processing

- the whistleblowing system should be able to be used without fear of
  consequences

- notifications should receive confirmation that they have been received
  as soon as possible and within no more than 14 days.

- the whistleblower should be notified of the outcome of the
  notification.

It must be ensured that consideration for the whistleblower is taken care of, see
further under section 7.

When follow-up of the notification entails the processing of personal data in
accordance with the Personal Data Act, the responsible case handler shall ensure that
personal data and sensitive personal data are processed in a lawful/prescribed manner.

If it is concluded that the notified condition is not censurable, the case may be closed
or the matters notified may be followed up in the most appropriate manner in the organization.

**7) Consideration to the whistleblower**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The employer (immediate line manager with personnel responsibility) shall ensure in particular
that the person who has blown the whistle has a fully satisfactory working environment. If
necessary, the employer shall provide measures suitable for the prevention of retaliation.

Retaliation against an employee who blows the whistle in accordance with
the guidelines is prohibited. Retaliation means any detrimental action,
practice or omission resulting from, or as a reaction to, the employee's
whistleblowing, such as

a) threats, harassment, unprofessional discrimination, social exclusion
   or other improper conduct

b) warning, change in work duties, reassignment or downgrading

c) suspension, dismissal, summary discharge,or disciplinary sanctions.

8) Consideration to the person subject to whistleblowing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the employer decides to pursue a notified case, the person about whom
the notification has been received should be informed of the
notification in the first instance and what information has been
provided, so that the person in question has the opportunity to present
their version of the case. Reservations are made for cases where, in
consideration for the further administrative procedure, it is important
that the person about whom the notification has been made is informed of
the notification.

The identity of the whistleblower should not be disclosed to the person
about whom the notification has been made. If the person about whom the
notification has been made requests access to information about the case
pursuant to the rules of the Public Administration Act, the person in
question is as a general rule entitled to be informed of the identity of
the whistleblower, however see section 9 regarding confidentiality
requirements for notifications to UiB as a public authority.

When the case has been processed, the person about whom the notification
has been made must be informed immediately, regardless of the outcome.

9) Notification to the University of Bergen as a public authority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When notifying UiB as a public authority, the employee's name or other
identifying information about the employee is subject to a duty of
confidentiality, cf.\ `Section 2 A-7 of the Working Environment
Act <https://lovdata.no/lov/2005-06-17-62/%C2%A72a-7>`__.

The duty of confidentiality also applies to the parties to the case and
their representatives.
