Adopted by University management on 7 April 2011 (jnr. 2011/4819)

**Part I. Registering hours**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Section 10-7 of the Working Environment Act requires that an account
  be kept of the hours worked by each employee. The account shall be
  accessible to the Labour Inspection Authority
| and the employees’ elected representatives. The requirement to
  register the hours worked
| must be adapted to the various work schedules at UiB.

**1 Employees with regular hours**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| This group comprises employees working regular daytime hours or who
  have a fixed system of
| staggered hours and an averaging of the hours, provided the timing of
  their
| hours is predictable.

| Employees with regular hours shall not keep accounts of their normal
  hours. However, they must register any deviations from their regular
  hours, and an account of deviations must be made available to their
  supervisor on request, or be submitted to the supervisor
| regularly (for instance monthly).

**2 Employees with variable hours**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Employees with variable hours pursuant to the Special agreement on
  flexible hours in the state,
| or individual agreements about flexible hours pursuant to section
  10-2(3) of the Working Environment Act, are not considered to have a
  sufficiently predictable timing of their hours to meet the statutory
  requirement to an account of work hours.

| Employees with flexible hours must therefore register their hours
  every day on a special form
| prepared by the Division of Human Resources. The account must be
  available
| to a supervisor on request or be submitted to a supervisor regularly
  (for example monthly).

**3 Employees exempted from chapter 10 of the Working Environment Act on working hours**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Employees in senior or particularly independent posts pursuant to
  section 10-12(1) and 10-12(2) of the Working Environment Act are
  exempt from most of the provisions in Chapter 10 of the Working
  Environment Act on working hours. The exemption also
| applies to section 10-7 of the Working Environment Act that requires
  an account of the hours worked to be prepared.

| The assessment of who has a senior or particularly independent post
  must be based on
| the degree to which the individual manages their own work in terms of
  its organisation and execution. The assessment is based on the typical
  characteristics of the different position categories and any
  individual deviations.

**3.1 Employees in senior posts**
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

| As detailed in the Working Environment Act, a senior post is a
  position with clear supervisory functions
| and an especially extensive authority to make independent work
  decisions. The assessment is based on the actual
| position and function. In making the assessment, it will also be
  significant
| whether the individual actually follows regular working hours.

| At UiB, the exemption for senior posts will normally include positions
  in the Rectorate, the University Director, Deans, Faculty Directors,
  Heads of Department and similar positions, as well as
| Departmental Directors in the administration. Positions such as Heads
  of Sections, supervisors in the administration, Head of Office, and
  similar positions will not normally be considered senior posts
  pursuant to the Working Environment Act.

Employees in senior posts are not subject to the requirement to keep an
account of their hours.

**3.2 Employees in particularly independent posts**
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Working Environment Act's "particularly independent posts" are
characterised by those holding these posts being "independent" in terms
of how and when they organise and execute their tasks. The employee can
decide how to prioritise among their tasks and decide when and how to
perform their work.

Research entails significant academic independence, in the form of the
freedom to choose questions, methods, the publication of research
results, etc. Furthermore, the employee manages the academic preparation
of their own teaching. If the employee manages the bulk of their tasks,
then this indicates that the employee is particularly independent.

If fixed hours, such as teaching, supervision at fixed hours,
administration or other managed tasks comprise the bulk of the FTE, this
indicates that the employee is not particularly independent.

**3.2.1 Posts that are normally particularly independent**
                                                          

The general principle is that employees in combined academic positions
at UiB are to spend equal time on research and teaching. The basic
characteristics of the position require that dissemination and
administration comprise a limited share of the tasks, and usually no
more than 10 per cent of working hours. Employees can make their own
decisions about the content and system of research, teaching and
dissemination in accordance with the provisions of the Act relating to
Universities and University Colleges regarding academic freedom and
responsibility.

Based on the terms used in the Working Environment Act and the entity's
organisation of the positions, the following UiB positions shall
generally be considered particularly independent:

Professor Position code 1013 and 1404

Associate Professor Position code 1011

Assistant Professor Position code 1010

This also applies to teaching positions that have formal qualifications
as the main objective and that include a limited share of required
duties:

Postdoctoral Fellow Position code 1352

Doctoral Research Fellow Position code 1017 and 1378

Specialist Fellow Position code 1476

Employees in these positions normally have a clear and obvious
independence in terms of how and when their work tasks are organised and
executed. Unless the employer confirms in writing that a specific
employee is not to be included, employees in the above-mentioned
positions are legally considered particularly independent.

Employees in particularly independent posts are not subject to the
requirement to keep accounts of their hours.

**3.2.2 Employees in positions that must be individually assessed in relation to the "particularly independent post" concept**
                                                                                                                              

Employees in the following position groups will have varying types of
tasks and work may be organised in different ways:

| Associate Professor Position code 1198
| Assistant Professor Position code 1009
| Dental Instructor Position code 1015 and 1353
| Dental Specialist Position code 1016
| Research Assistant Position code 1018, 1019 and 1020
| Researcher Position code 1108, 1109, 1110 and1183 (temporary in
  externally funded research projects)

Whether individual employees in these positions fall under the legal
definition of "particularly independent" must be assessed by a
supervisor based on the specific individual circumstances.

Individual assessments must be based on the typical characteristics of
the category of the position in question. The individual element will
relate to variations in the actual work for each employee, as compared
to the typical criteria for the position category.

If the conclusion is that the employee is not considered particularly
independent, the employee will be covered by the ordinary provisions in
the Working Environment Act about working hours, as supplemented by the
provisions of the Basic Agreement. This includes the requirement in
section 10-7 of the Working Environment Act that "an account shall be
kept of the hours worked by each employee." If the employee can vary the
timing of their hours (flexible hours) themself, the employee must keep
an updated account of the hours worked per day. The account must be
available to a supervisor on request or be submitted regularly to a
supervisor (for example monthly).

**3.2.3 Other legal effects of being in a senior or particularly independent post**
                                                                                   

Employees in senior and particularly independent posts have the same
legal status as employees in other positions with regard to the
employer's management prerogatives and the employer's right to manage,
allocate and control the work. The content of the employment contract is
also the same in that the employees are required to work 37.5 hours a
week. The positions are also subject to framework in the Basic Agreement
regarding working hours, in part because working hours shall as far as
possible be between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday. However,
this must be understood as referencing the working hours governed by
someone other than the employee, such as the timing of classes set by
the employer. Otherwise, the starting point is that employees in
particularly independent posts themselves decide when to work the hours
they regulate themselves. The employee is also required to comply with
the times set for teaching, project participation, meetings or other
activities in which the timing is governed by the employer. In general,
the employee is required to be present at their ordinary place of work
unless there are academic reasons for working elsewhere.

**Part II. Registration of overtime**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The overtime framework is stipulated in section 10-6 of the Working
Environment Act and section 13 of the Basic Agreement.

| Section 13(1) of the Basic Agreement requires that "overtime work must
  be imposed and controllable and must be limited in accordance with the
  requirements in the Working Environment Act."
| Section 10-6(1) of the Working Environment Act includes a caveat that
  "work in excess of agreed working hours must not take place except in
  cases when there is an exceptional and time-limited need for it."

Regardless of the organisation of an employee's hours, the general
conditions are that:

-  overtime can only be imposed in extraordinary circumstances. In other
   words, it cannot be used to cover a permanent need for labour power.
-  overtime must be explicitly imposed by a supervisor, who must also be
   able to control and confirm that the overtime work has been
   completed.

**1 Overtime for employees subject to chapter 10 of the Working Environment Act**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For employees subject to chapter 10 of the Working Environment Act, the
limits of daily, weekly and yearly overtime work are stipulated in
section 10-6 of the Act. Overtime work shall not exceed 10 hours in a
seven-day period, 25 hours in four consecutive weeks, or 200 hours a
year.

The Act assumes a 40-hour week, but state employees have a 37.5-hour
work week pursuant to collective agreements. This means that the weekly
overtime limits can be extended by 2.5 hours. However, this does not
mean that employees are automatically able to work an extra 130 hours
overtime a year on top of the 200-hour limit ("saving" the extra quota).
The expanded quota only applies week by week, i.e. to the difference
between 40 hours and 37.5 hours. The annual number of "extra hours" will
thus be determined based on the actual weekly overtime for each
employee.

Total work hours (regular hours and overtime) cannot exceed 13 hours in
any 24-hour period.

**1.1 Employees with regular hours**
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

| Each employee must register overtime imposed by the employer on an
  overtime form.
| Overtime must also be registered as a deviations from the regular
  hours, and the account of deviations must be made available to a
  supervisor on request, or be submitted to a supervisor regularly (e.g.
  monthly).

**1.2 Employees with variable hours**
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If the employer requires an employee who is subject to the Special
agreement on flexible hours in the state to work beyond ordinary working
hours, this must be compensated by overtime pay pursuant to section
13(2) and 13(3) of the Basic Agreement. The employee cannot be required
to work flexible hours outside of ordinary working hours.

Each employee must register imposed overtime on an overtime form and in
the form for registering flexible hours. Imposed overtime that according
to the agreement is to be compensated by time off and additional hours
in the flexible hours calculations must be kept separate. The accounts
must be available to a supervisor on request or be submitted to a
supervisor regularly (e.g monthly).

**2 Overtime for employees who are exempt from chapter Working Environment Act**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Employees in senior or particularly independent posts are generally
  not entitled to
| compensation for overtime, in accordance with section 13(4) of the
  Basic Agreement.

However, overtime compensation can nevertheless be paid when employees
follow those whom they manage, enter a shift schedule, or have overtime
imposed by a senior supervisor who can control the performance of the
work. In the latter case, overtime compensation can be paid for up to
300 hours each calendar year.

| In its comments to section 13(4) of the Basic Agreement, the Ministry
  of Education and Research has assumed that the employees in such cases
| "must be located in such a manner that they have supervisors who can
  impose and control their
| overtime work. If these prerequisites are not met, overtime
  compensation cannot be paid ... The immediate supervisor must confirm
  that the overtime work has been imposed. Overtime must be documented
  by registration of the hours worked."

| The provision in section 13(4) of the Basic Agreement does not require
  any special registration of regular hours in order to pay compensation
  for overtime work. The requirement is only that
| the employee has a supervisor who can issue orders and control
  performance. In other words,
| it is the actual overtime work (when and for how long) that must be
  registered.

Overtime shall be documented by a supervisor approving an overtime form
in which the overtime hours are listed by times, and thereby confirming
that the overtime has been imposed and performed.
