**Regulations concerning promotion in teaching and research positions**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Determined by the University Board: 28/04/2016

The regulations on employment and promotion in teaching and research
positions have changed as of 17/08/ 2015. The wording of Section 2-1
reads as follows after the change:

"Promotion can only be applied for through the employee’s own
institution and applications must be submitted to the institution. The
requirements set out pursuant to Section 1-1 to 1-7 apply in connection
with promotions. The institutions are free to decide that assessments
performed by specialist committees established by other institutions can
be used as the basis for the institution's considerations for
promotions."

The University Board adopts the following rules for promotion in
teaching and research positions at the University of Bergen:

1. As a rule, promotion in teaching and research positions can be
applied for only following assessments carried out by specialist
committees established by the University of Bergen.

2. The University Board delegates to the faculty board and the
university museum board within their academic area the ability to decide
that assessments performed by specialist committees established by other
institutions can be used as the basis for the institution's
considerations for promotions."

3. Provisions concerning assessments performed by specialist committees
established by other institutions can be used as the basis for the
institution's considerations for promotions but must be in accordance
with national regulations and the following internal regulations at the
University of Bergen:

3.1 Approval of assessments performed by specialist committees
established by other institutions can be given only when the
institution, as a minimum, sets out equivalent requirements for
competence for a position to those set out by the University of Bergen.

3.2 Approval of assessments performed by specialist committees
established by other institutions must be a general approval of all
assessments performed by the other institution. It is not possible to
limit the approval decision to individual applications.

3.3 If, for specific groups of employees, the University of Bergen sets
out general requirements concerning competence beyond the minimum
requirements set out in Section 1-2 to 1-7 of the regulations, such
additional requirements must apply over time, for employment and
promotions at the University of Bergen and must be available to
employees and applicants.

Approval of assessments performed by specialist committees established
by other institutions can be made only when the institution, as a
minimum, sets out equivalent additional requirements for these employee
groups to those set out by the University of Bergen.

4. An achieved certification of competence for professor II positions
cannot form the basis for promotion to professor without a new
assessment being performed. In cases where a complete professor
competence assessment has been performed for the employment as professor
II, it will not be necessary to carry out a new assessment.

5. The annual application deadline for promotion to professor is 15
September. In special cases, the rector may approve the waiving of this
deadline.
