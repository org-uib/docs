**Guidelines for the allocation of research leave and specific time arrangements for R&D initiatives**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Determined by the University Board: 28/04/2016

1. Purpose
----------

Research leave is allocated every seven years and will contribute to
strengthening and developing research, innovation and research-based
teaching for scientific employees with research competence. Research
leave must be arranged for the purpose of continuous specialisation in
the employee’s own research, new product development or establishment of
research collaborations with other research environments, nationally or
internationally.

The option of research and development work focusing on mobility and
career development can be granted through specific time arrangements for
R&D initiatives, c.f. item 3.

2. Research leave
-----------------

2.1 Who is entitled to apply for research leave?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Permanently employed professors and assistant professors in at least 50%
positions can apply for research leave.

Associate professors who have been personally promoted from the position
of university lecturer/senior lecturer in accordance with the
regulations for the Act relating to universities and university colleges
concerning employment and promotion in teaching and research positions
cannot apply for research leave but can apply for time arrangements for
R&D initiatives.

2.2 Accrual of research leave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The accrual period for research leave of one year is a total of six
years' service as a professor or associate professor in a minimum 50%
position or three years for a six-month research leave period. If
indicated by special circumstances, applications for shorter research
leave may be granted with a corresponding shortening of the accrual
period. A new accrual period will commence upon completion of the
research leave.

Research leave are allocated subject to the employee having carried out
ordinary research, teaching and administrative duties during the accrual
period or having managed major research projects. Statutory paid leave
and periods as a salaried employee representative are considered equal
to ordinary duties.

Those entitled to apply and who hold office/employment as, for example,
rector, pro-rector, deputy rector, dean, pro-dean, deputy dean and head
of institute will accrue one year's research leave upon completion of
the period. Research leave of two years can be granted for multiple
consecutive periods in such roles.

Those entitled to apply and salaried employee representatives with a job
percentage of 50% of more will accrue a research leave of one year
following four years of consecutive service.

By special resolution, the University Board may determine shorter
accrual periods for research leave for offices/employees with especially
weighty academic/administrative tasks at or outside of the University of
Bergen.

2.3 Research leave application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Research leave applications must be submitted to the institute. The
application must include a plan for the research leave. The plan should,
among other things, include:

-  The research activities, etc. that will be implemented
-  Project description
-  Expected results of the research
-  Place of work during the leave
-  Proposed funding for the research project

Application deadlines are determined by each faculty.

2.4. Allocation of research leave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Upon the expiration of the application deadline, the institute will
  prepare recommendations based on the application received.
| The recommendation may cover:

-  submitted research plans, research collaborations with international
   research environments and interdisciplinary projects
-  results from previous research leave and special research efforts
   during the accrual period
-  prolonged heavy loads in teaching, committee work and other
   administrative roles
-  The fact that no previous research leave have been applied for or
   granted
-  women's need to qualify for senior positions
-  a description of how teaching will be maintained in a proper manner
   and how tutoring of master’s degree/doctoral students will be
   continued in a satisfactory manner.

The faculty will process the research leave applications on the basis of
the recommendations from the institute. The faculties will decide on the
applications and allocate research leave, as well as determining any
temporary cover expenses.

If, for reasons relating to teaching, it would not be possible to
allocate research leave to all applicants with sufficient time accrued,
a prioritisation of applications must be performed. The recommendation
of the head of institute will form the basis for such prioritisation.

Applicants who are not awarded research leave for reasons relating to
teaching will be prioritised for research leave in the next application
round. In such cases, the period of the postponement will be included in
the next accrual period.

Rejected applications must be justified. Upon appeal from the applicant,
a rejection may be overturned by the superior authority, which is the
rector if the faculty board is acting as the allocating authority.

The faculty may delegate the allocation of research leave to the
institute.

2.5 Implementation of research leave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The research leave must be implemented in accordance with the purpose of
the scheme. As a general rule, the leave must be implemented in
connection with the accrued period.

If the leave is not implemented immediately upon completion of accrual,
the faculties may grant a postponement. The postponement period will
then be included in the next accrual period up to a maximum of four
semesters.

If the leave is interrupted due to long-term illness or childbirth, an
agreement can be reached so that the rest of the leave can be
implemented at a later date.

During the leave, the employee shall be exempt from teaching duties,
clinical and administrative duties, as well as attendance requirements
at their ordinary place of work. During the leave, the employee will be
considered to be on paid leave outside of the University of Bergen.
Normal holiday periods should be implemented during the leave.

The person to whom a research leave has been granted has a duty to
implement the plan that formed the basis for the application. It is not
permitted to carry out work, assignments, teaching, exams, tutoring,
office or anything else that could prevent or delay the implementation
of the plans without consent from the allocating authority.

It is not normally possible to implement a research leave during a
fixed-term/elected period.

2.6 Reporting on research leave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The faculty expects to receive a written report within two months of
conclusion of the research leave. Rules on reporting are provided by
each faculty.

3. Specific time arrangements for R&D initiatives
-------------------------------------------------

Following application, the option of specific time arrangements for R&D
initiatives can be granted for permanent employees in minimum 50%
positions as docent, senior lecturer or associate researcher who have
personally been promoted from the role of university lecturer/senior
lecturer.

In order to be eligible to apply for specific time arrangements for R&D
initiatives for up to three months, the employee must have had at least
three years’ consecutive service in permanent employment with research
competence in a minimum 50% position in a category entitled to apply, or
for up to six months following six years consecutive service.

The application must provide a description of the R&D initiatives that
will be implemented, as well as a project specification.

The application deadline is the same as for research leave and will be
determined by the faculty.

The head of institute will make decisions regarding the applications and
allocate specific time arrangements for R&D initiatives. The decisions
will be based on planned R&D activities, the project specification,
financing and the R&D profile of the institute.

Rejected applications must be justified. Upon appeal from the applicant,
rejections may be overturned by the faculty board.

The R&D initiative must be implemented in accordance with the purpose of
the scheme, which is mobility and career development and must be
implemented by agreement with the head of institute.
