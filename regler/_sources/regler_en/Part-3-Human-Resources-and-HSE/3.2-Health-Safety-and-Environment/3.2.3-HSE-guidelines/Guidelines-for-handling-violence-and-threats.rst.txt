1. Purpose
~~~~~~~~~~

These guidelines shall help prevent violence and threats and ensure that

2. Basis
~~~~~~~~

| These guidelines form part of the University of Bergen (UiB)
  Regulations (Part 3 Human Resources and HSE), and are based on the

  (Internal Control Regulations), Regulations concerning the Performance
  of Work and the UiB Emergency Preparedness Plan.

3. Scope and area of application

In this context, "third-party" means persons who are not UiB employees

the latter's work situation.

Violence and threats between employees and/or leaders are handled in
accordance with UiB's :doc:`Guidelines for conflict
management </regler_en/Part-3-Human-Resources-and-HSE/3.1-Human-Resources/3.1.7-Conflict-management/Guidelines-for-conflict-management>`
and :doc:`Guidelines for Notification
(Whistleblowing) </regler_en/Part-3-Human-Resources-and-HSE/3.1-Human-Resources/3.1.6-Notification-Whistleblowing/Guidelines-for-whistleblowing-at-the-University-of-Bergen>`.

entails mapping dangers, assessing risks, preparing plans and
prioritising measures, and implementing measures to reduce the risk
factors.

| **Mapping and risk assessments**
| The line managers shall ensure that risks are mapped and assessed. The
  mapping will identify activities that may entail a risk of violence
  and threats. The Safety delegate and employee representatives shall
  participate in this work along with the line manager.

When the risks have been mapped and assessed, the line manager shall
prepare plans and ensure that measures are implemented to reduce the
risk factors.

| **Information ang training**
| The line manager is responsible for ensuring that the employees
  receive necessary information and adapted training related to the
  completed risk assessment, so as to enable them to effectively handle
  violence and threats.

observed another employee be the target of violence or threats must
contact their line manager as soon as possible and inform them about the
incident.

If necessary, the line manager must initiate the UiB Emergency
Preparedness Plan.

evaluation shall be an integrated part of the university's systematic
HSE work, internal plans and regulations.
