**1. Purpose**

handles chemicals at the University of Bergen does so in a safe and
proper manner.

**2. Legal basis**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These guidelines form part of the University’s Rules and Regulations
(Part 3. Human Resources and HSE) and have their legal basis in HSE
legislation (see reference).

**3. Scope and area of application**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These guidelines apply to all work with chemicals at and under the
auspices of the University of Bergen, except for those projects and
activities that, pursuant to other collaborative agreements, must comply
with other guidelines for HSE work.
