1. Objective
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The objective of these guidelines is to ensure that fieldwork, research
cruises as well as other group trips are conducted in accordance with
sound health, safety and environment principles.

**2. Scope and area of application**

-  Recommended:

   -  For employees on group trip with a minimum of 5 employees
   -  For a minimum of 1 employee on group trip with one or more
      students.

The guidelines apply both to the HSE aspects of the employee’s
obligatory fieldwork and research cruise under the ‘Agreement concerning
fieldwork for employees at the University of Bergen’ (NO) and to HSE
aspects of fieldwork and research cruises that is not obligatory and
that take place in connection with the employee’s own research.

Where employees with different employers or students from different
educational institutions participate in joint fieldwork/research
cruises/group trip, it must be decided in advance which
employer/institution has the overall HSE responsibility.

Separate guidelines will apply to UiB students on exchange programmes
abroad.
