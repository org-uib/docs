   purchase agreement with UiB.
-  The employee fills out page 1 in the form ”\ `Eye examination and
   computer
   glasses <http://ekstern.filer.uib.no/poa/Hms/Databriller/The%20form%20Eye%20examinations%20and%20computer%20glasses%20(5).pdf>`__\ ”,
   and brings this to the optician, see attachment.

   this will be documented at page 2 in the form ”Eye examination and
   computer glasses”. Costs will be refunded as shown in these
   guidelines, section 6.3.
-  If the optician finds that computer glasses is necessary, this will
   be documented at page 2 in the form ”Eye examination and computer
   glasses”. Computer glasses must be ordered at the optician that has a
   purchase agreement with UiB. Costs will be refunded as shown in these
   guidelines, section 6.3.
-  If the eye examination at the optician shows that the employee needs
   further examination by an eye specialist, the employee will get a
   referral. The eye specialist signs at page 2 in the form ”Eye
   examination and computer glasses”. Costs will be refunded as shown in
   these guidelines, section 6.3

   must be used.
-  Expenses related to eye examination and computer glasses are covered
   by the unit’s assets.
-  According to the purchase agreement, UiB will refund expenses for:

   -  Eye vision examination
   -  Single vision lenses, computer bifocal lenses or counter/room
      bifocal lenses adapted to the distance to the computer screen.
   -  Frame for computer glasses up until 750 NOK.
   -  When additional examination by an eye specialist is required, the
      patient’s payment, according to The Norwegian Medical Association
      rate, is refunded when the referral is related to work in front of
      a computer screen.
   -  Ordinary glasses are not refundable.

6.4 Follow up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Computer glasses paid by UiB must be used at work. UiB assumes that
   the frame and lenses will last for 5 years, unless changes in vision
   necessitate replacement of lenses. Optician can confirm if new lenses
   are required.
-  The general rule is that the employee retains the glasses when he or
   she leaves UiB. If the glasses are acquired during the last six
   months before the employee leaves UiB, the employee can buy the
   glasses from the unit where he/she works. The unit will then set the
   price.
