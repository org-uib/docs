1. Objective
~~~~~~~~~~~~

These guidelines shall ensure:

- that breaches of the health and safety and working environment regulations
  (HSE non-conformities) at the University of Bergen (UiB) are handled in
  accordance with regulatory requirements and internal policies that health, 
  safety and environment non-conformities at the University of Bergen (UiB)
  are handled in accordance with regulatory requirements and internal rules
- that the working and learning environment is fully satisfactory
- that all HSE non-conformities are reported
- that corrective and preventive measures are considered and implemented

2. Scope
~~~~~~~~

The guidelines cover HSE non-conformities and apply to all employees, students
and visitors at UiB and all activities organised under the auspices of the university.

Safety non-conformities are also defined and anchored in the :doc:`Management System for securing buildings and
values </regler/Del-4-OEkonomi-eiendom-og-IKT/4.2-Drifts-og-eiendomsforvaltning/4.2.5-Styringssystem-for-sikring-av-bygg-og-verdier/Del-1-Styrende-del-Styringssystem-for-sikring-av-bygg-og-verdier/>` (NO), 
which provides detailed guidelines for the management of buildings and physical (material) values. 
This document establishes that safety non-conformities shall be reported and followed up as
HSE non-conformities. Safety non-conformities include breaches of the management system for securing 
buildings and values, burglaries and unauthorised entry, major building damage and damage/loss of
physical assets because of fire, theft, vandalism, leaks, or issues related to indoor
climate. Safety non-conformities are for practical purposes further referred to as HSE non-conformities.

Units that have a coordination agreement on HSE with another establishment shall handle HSE non-conformities in compliance with the applicable agreement.

In the event of undesired events requiring resources beyond ordinary operations, the relevant :doc:`Emergency Preparedness 
plan </regler/Del-1-Overordnede-rammer/1.6-Beredskapsplan-ved-UiB/Beredskapsplan-for-Universitetet-i-Bergen/>` (NO)
should be considered to be implemented.
