---------------------------------------------------------------

:doc:`Norwegian version </regler/Del-3-Personal-og-HMS/3.2-Helse-miljoe-og-sikkerhet/3.2.3-HMS-retningslinjer/Retningslinjer-for-straalevern-og-bruk-av-straaling-ved-UiB>`

Approved by the University Director October 04, 2018, last modified October 11, 2022, archive reference 2018/11476.

**1. Purpose**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The guidelines must ensure that radiation protection and use of
radiation sources at the University of Bergen are carried out and
documented in accordance with the requirements of the authorities and
internal rules.

**2. Legal basis**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The guidelines are part of UiB’s Rules and Regulations (part 3.
Personnel and HSE) and are based on HSE legislation.

**3. Scope**
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The guidelines apply to all work/activities organized by the UiB where
radiation are handled. If a coordination agreement exists regarding
health, safety, and the environment with any other establishment the
applicable coordination agreement must be followed.

**4. Responsibilities**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Line managers are responsible for ensuring that the guidelines are
publicised and monitored within their area of responsibility

**5. Definitions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Radiation:* Ionising and non-ionising radiation.

*Ionising radiation:* Radiation containing sufficient energy, as
particles or electromagnetic radiation, to strike an electron away from
the atom and/or molecule that has been hit, in such a way that an ion is
generated. That is, radiation with a wavelength of 100 nm or shorter
(energy above 12.6 eV)

*Non-ionising radiation:* Electromagnetic radiation with an energy that
is not sufficient to ionise an atom and/or molecule it collides with.
That is radiation with a wavelength longer than 100 nm (energy below
12.6 eV), including electrical and magnetic fields.

*Radiation sources:* Radioactive compounds, goods or equipment
containing such compounds, as well as plant, apparatus, or equipment
that may emit radiation.

*Risk assessment:* Identification of undesirable incidents, followed by
a systematic review of what might cause undesirable incidents and what
consequences these may have for the working and learning environment.
The risk assessment must identify risk-reduction measures and provide a
basis for the contingency work.

*Line manager:* The University Director, the Dean, faculty director,
department director and head of department or equivalent who has the
ultimate responsibility for health and safety and the working
environment in the unit.

**6. Organisation and approvals**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**6.1 Organisation**

The University Director must:

-  Appoint a central radiation protection coordinator.
-  Ensure in cooperation with the central radiation protection
   coordinator that the annual report and other requirements from the
   Norwegian Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority are followed up.

Central radiation protection coordinator:

-  Shall administer UiB's systematic work on radiation protection.
-  Must, as a minimum requirement, have completed a three day course in
   radiation protection with a pass in the course test and have at least
   two years experience of working with radioactive sources.
-  Has the authority, on behalf of the university director, to stop any
   work that is in violation of applicable laws and regulations.

Within his/her area of responsibility, the line manager or his/her
representative shall:

-  Appoint a local radiation protection coordinator.
-  Ensure that all work with radiation protection and use of radiation
   follows laws and regulations.
-  Ensure that risk assessments are carried out before using radiation
   sources and before starting new activities where radiation sources
   are used.

The local radiation protection coordinator must:

-  Administer the local radiation protection work.
-  Ensure that all work with radioactive sources, including purchase of
   waste treatment is in accordance with the applicable laws and
   regulations at any given time.
-  Report to the central radiation protection coordinator.
-  As a minimum requirement, have completed a three day course in
   radiation protection with a pass in the course test and have at least
   two years experience of working with radiation.

User:

-  Must be familiar with and understand the applicable guidelines,
   procedures and routines.
-  Must as a minimum receive training by the local radiation protection
   coordinator before starting work and as soon as possible complete a
   radiation protection course:

   -  Permanent employees, PhD’s, project employees or students who use
      radiation sources on a regular basis must complete a three-day
      course and pass the course test. In this case, a regular basis
      means monthly or more often.
   -  Permanent employees, PhD’s, project employees or guests who use
      radiation sources for a short period must complete a one-day
      course in radiation protection.
   -  The training must include internal procedures, instructions, risk,
      protective and measuring equipment, waste management and
      non-conformance management.

-  Prior to starting work, must become familiar with the risk
   assessments that have been carried out.

**6.2 Implementation**

-  Any use of radiation must be justified. This means that the use of
   radiation must be necessary and lead to so small doses and so low
   exposure to the environment as possible.
-  A competent person must carry out any work with radiation sources.
   For this purpose, a competent person means a person who has undergone
   the necessary training.
-  A risk assessment must be carried out for all work with radiation
   sources.
-  All limit values for working with radioactive sources given in the
   Radiation Protection Regulations, Guidelines 2 and Regulations on
   measures and limit values must be complied with.
-  If a risk assessment shows that an individual may be exposed to more
   than 6 mSv per twelve months, the individual must undergo a health
   examination.
-  If a risk assessment shows that an individual may be exposed to more
   than 1 mSv per year, personal dosimeter is required.
-  As soon as a pregnancy is known, the employer must ensure that the
   dose to the foetus does not exceed 1 mSv for the remainder of the
   pregnancy.
-  If the pregnant woman so wishes, the employer must as far as possible
   offer alternative tasks or relocation.
-  All non-conformances must immediately be notified to the local
   radiation protection coordinator and via UiB’s electronic
   notification system for `HSE
   non-conformities <https://avvik.app.uib.no/apex/f?p=692:1::::::>`__.
-  The central radiation protection coordinator must, within three days,
   notify any serious non-conformances to the Norwegian Radiation and
   Nuclear Safety Authority (see Guideline 2 for supplementary examples
   of situations to be notified):

   -  serious unintentional exposure of an individual
   -  emissions into the environment
   -  loss of radiation sources

-  Radioactive waste must be managed in accordance with applicable laws
   and regulations, (see “Guidelines for the disposal of hazardous waste
   and problem waste, ionising radiation sources and explosive waste”).
