1. Objective
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that the elements of
systematic health, safety and environment work (HSE) at the University
of Bergen (UiB) are in compliance with government requirements and
internal regulations, to assess whether the activities in the HSE work
are in line with UiB’s objectives and identify any potential for
improvement, so that measures can be considered and prioritised.

2. Basis
~~~~~~~~

The guidelines form part of UiB’s Regulations (Part 3. Human Resources
and HSE) and are based on the Norwegian Regulations relating to
Systematic health, safety and environment work in Enterprises (Internal
Control Regulations) section 5 no 8.

3. Scope and area of application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These guidelines apply to all units at UiB.

4. Responsibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Line Manager* is responsible for implementing and following up these
guidelines.

5. Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Line Manager:* University Director, Dean/Faculty/Division Director and
   Head of department/section, or equivalent with overall HSE responsibility
   at the unit.
-  *Unit:* Faculty, division, section, department and centre at UiB.

6. Annual review of systematic HSE work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

6.1. Organisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Line Manager reviews the systematic HSE work and reports according to
line. If potential for improvement is identified, corrective measures
shall be considered and prioritised.

Safety Delegate shall review the systematic HSE work together with the
Line Manager.

6.2. Review 
^^^^^^^^^^^

The following elements of the systematic HSE work shall be reviewed:

-  Consider whether HSE goals have been achieved, and set new HSE goals.
-  Responsibility and distribution of tasks within the HSE work.
-  HSE action plan.

   -  Results of HSE mapping, such as HSE meetings and HSE rounds,
      risk assessments and prioritise measures.

-  Reported non-conformities, near-accidents and accidents.
-  Ensure that existing routines and plans are appropriate and in
   compliance with regulations.
-  Check that new activities/processes are carried out in a safe manner.
-  Map HSE training needs for the coming year.
-  Carry out necessary updates of HSE documents.

6.3. Reporting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The University Director requests annual reports of the status of local
HSE work:

-  The Line Manager, in collaboration with the Safety Delegate, completes
   the annual report form and returns it according to line.
-  Faculty Directors and Directors of the University Museum of Bergen
   and the University of Bergen Library with their respective Chief
   Safety Delegates shall compile an overall HSE report for the unit.
   The report is reviewed by the Board and forwarded to the University
   Director.
-  UiB's annual HSE report, where local HSE reports are important 
   elements, is reviewed by the University Board. The board uses the 
   report to gather input for decisions governing HSE work at UiB.

6.4 Follow-up
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The University Director reviews the local HSE reports and provides
   necessary feedback, and conducts "a management review" at each
   faculty / department to be followed up by the local unit and at the
   faculty / department”.
