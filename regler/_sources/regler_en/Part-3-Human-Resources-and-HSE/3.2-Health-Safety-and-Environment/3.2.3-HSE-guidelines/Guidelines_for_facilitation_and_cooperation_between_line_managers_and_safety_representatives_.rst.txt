1. Purpose
~~~~~~~~~~

The University of Bergen (UiB) wants to ensure good cooperation between line managers and safety
representatives. This is done by setting aside sufficient time at all levels to carry out the 
safety representative role in a prudent manner. Regular meetings between safety representatives
and line managers will facilitate active cooperation between line managers and safety 
representatives in the systematic health, safety and environment (HSE) work at UiB. 

2. Legal basis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The guidelines are part of UiB’s Rules and Regulations (Part 3 Personnel and HSE) and are 
underpinned by HSE legislation. 

3. Scope
~~~~~~~~

The guidelines include the entire University, all levels and units at the University.

4. Responsibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The line manager is responsible for implementing and following up the guidelines. 

5. Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Line manager: University Director, Dean, Faculty/department director and Head of
  department, or equivalent who has the overall HSE responsibility at the unit 
- Safety representative: the University's chief safety representative (UCSR), the chief
  safety representative (CSR) and safety representative (SR)
- Deputy safety representative: Deputy UCSR, deputy CSR, deputy SR.

6. Training
~~~~~~~~~~~

Safety representatives at UiB must complete 40 hours of basic HSE training, cf. Regulations
concerning Organisation, Management and Employee Participation section 3-18. 

7. Facilitation and cooperation  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

7.1 Organisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within his/her area of responsibility, the line manager must: 

- Ensure facilitation and cooperation between the line manager and safety representative. 
- Follow up any coordination agreements with other employers, cf. the Internal Control 
  Regulations section 6. 
- Ensure that the safety representative has sufficient HSE expertise to function in the
  position.  

Within their area of responsibility, safety representatives shall: 

- Be familiar with the guidelines.  
- Ensure that the employer fulfils its responsibilities pursuant to regulatory requirements
  and the University’s internal rules.
- Participate in the planning and implementation of the systematic HSE work.   

In addition, the safety representative must be familiar with the provisions concerning the 
safety representative’s duty of secrecy (cf. the Regulations concerning Organisation, 
Management and Employee Participation section 3-17).

Within their area of responsibility, deputy safety representatives shall: 

- Be familiar with the guidelines and be able to step in if the safety representative is
  prevented from performing his/her duties. In those situations where the deputy safety
  representative assumes responsibility, the same rules apply to the deputy safety 
  representative as for the safety representative. 
- Be invited to participate in relevant meetings in order to be able to fulfill the position. 
 
UCSR and CSR are also responsible for coordinating the safety representatives’ activities
within their occupational health and safety areas, cf. the Working Environment Act section
6-1 (3), and the Regulations concerning Organisation, Management and Employee Participation
section 3-5. 

7.2 Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Start-up meeting**

In the case of a new safety representative and/or line manager, a start-up meeting must be
held to initiate and ensure good cooperation between the line manager and safety representative.


**Regular meetings between line management and safety services** 

The line manager must ensure and facilitate regular meetings between the safety representative
and line manager. Safety representatives, deputy safety representatives and line managers must
meet at least every three months. Minutes must be kept in meetings between the line manager and
safety representative.  

The line managers and safety representative must plan, carry out and follow up annual mappings
of the physical and psychosocial working environment, and other measures that have an impact on
the working environment within the safety representative's area, also during change and readjustment
processes. The line manager and safety representative conduct annual HSE reporting cf. Guidelines 
for annual review of the systematic health, environment and safety work (internal control).  

The regular meetings between the line manager and safety representative must facilitate good 
dialogue and exchange of information on the working environment situation of the area in question.
If special circumstances arise between the regular meetings that may affect the working environment,
the line manager must summon a meeting as soon as possible. 

The chief safety representatives take part in the management’s review of the annual HSE report for 
the various main occupational health and safety areas.  

**Time to perform the duties of safety representative** 

The line manager and safety representative shall ensure that the safety representative is afforded
sufficient time to perform his/her duties. The parties must jointly consider any consequences the 
position may have for the safety representative’s ordinary tasks and consider specific solutions. 
This should be done at the beginning of the safety representative period. 

Just as SR, CSR must be given sufficient time to perform his/her duties. For CSR partial release 
from his/her ordinary duties is appropriate, where the scope of release may vary according to the
size of and activities at the unit. UCSR at UiB has 100% release from duties, and for deputy UCSR
there is partial release. 

If unexpected circumstances arise that entail that safety representative work must be carried out
beyond ordinary work hours pursuant to the Working Environment Act section 10-4, it shall be 
compensated as overtime, cf. the Working Environment Act section 6-5 (3). If unexpected circumstances
arise that require action on the part of the safety representative, the safety representative is 
entitled to leave the workplace. If this happens, the safety representative must inform the line manager. 

7.3 The occupational health and safety service 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Regular meetings in the safety representative organisation**

The following meetings between the University’s safety representatives are established:
 
- UCSR and CSR: Monthly.  
- UCSR, CSR and SR: Takes place at the regular SR gatherings that are organised in the spring, and
  the competency day that is organised in the autumn for all safety representatives at UiB 
- CSR and SR: Monthly.  

**Committee**

The safety representative must attend the following committee at UiB: 

- The Working Environment Committee (WEC): UCSR is a member. 
- The Negotiation Committee: UCSR attends when there are plans regarding rationalisation
  (restructuring) and questions related to working hour schemes cf. the University’s adjustment
  agreement to the General Agreement for State Employees, chapter 6. 
- Information and discussion committee (IDC): CSR attends when there are plans regarding
  rationalisation (restructuring) and questions related to working hour schemes cf. the 
  University’s adjustment agreement to the General Agreement for State Employees, chapter 6.
- HSE committee: the safety representative at the closest level attends.

8. Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Facilitation and cooperation between the line manager and safety representative must be evaluated
annually as a part of the Guideline for annual review of the systematic health, safety and
environment work (internal control).
