Approved by the University Director December 10, 2020, last modified October 14, 2021, archive reference 2014/8109.

1. Purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aim of these guidelines is to help ensure that everyone who uses and handles biological 
risk factors at the University of Bergen does so in a safe and proper manner.

2. Scope
~~~~~~~~

The guidelines apply to all work with biological risk factors at and under the governance 
of the University of Bergen. When employees with different employers share premises or 
take part in joint activities, the enterprises shall coordinate HSE work in order to ensure
a thoroughly sound working environment (section 2-2 of the `Norwegian Working Environment Act <https://lovdata.no/dokument/NLE/lov/2005-06-17-62/KAPITTEL_2#%C2%A72-2>`__).

3. RESPONSIBILITIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The line manager is responsible for the guidelines being known and followed up by the unit.
- Employees, students, and guest researchers who use and handle biological risk factors shall 
  follow the guidelines.

4. Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Line manager: Head of Department, division manager or equivalent, who has overall responsibility
for the unit.
 
Biological risk factors: Living or dead biological material (such as bacteria, fungi, parasites,
cell cultures, virus, prions, toxins, and allergens) that may have harmful effects (such as 
infections, allergic reactions, or poisoning) for humans or the environment (such as animals or plants).
 
Microorganisms: Any cellular or non-cellular microbiological entity that can reproduce itself or 
transferring genetic material, also including viruses, viroids, animal and plant cells in culture.
Infection risk group: Classification of living biological risk factors according to the risk of 
infection they represent in accordance with `section 6-1 of the Regulations concerning measures 
and thresholds <https://lovdata.no/dokument/SFE/forskrift/2011-12-06-1358/KAPITTEL_6#%C2%A76-1>`__.

`Containment measures <https://lovdata.no/dokument/SFE/forskrift/2011-12-06-1356/KAPITTEL_8#%C2%A78-4>`__: 
Measures or barriers used to prevent the biological risk factor coming into 
contact or causing harm to humans or the environment. These may be physical barriers (such as 
underpressure in the laboratory) or biological barriers (conditions that prevent the biological
risk factor from causing harm outside a contained area, such as an organism that cannot reproduce
outside the laboratory due to low temperatures).  

5. Organisation and approvals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5.1 Approval
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Committee for biosecurity 

- An advisory committee at the University of Bergen, for the introduction 
  and use of biological risk factors including GMOs.

The line manager shall:

  <https://lovdata.no/dokument/SFE/forskrift/2011-12-06-1357/KAPITTEL_2-5#%C2%A76-3>`__
  before the unit starts using biological risk factors in infection risk groups 2, 3 and 4, and 
  ensure that the workplace has a sufficient `level of containment.
  <https://lovdata.no/dokument/SFE/forskrift/2011-12-06-1356/KAPITTEL_8#%C2%A78-4>`__ 
  
- The purpose of the notifications is that the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority will know that

- Sufficient training and knowledge have been provided prior to starting work with biological risk
  factors. The training must be documented.
- Necessary safety measures and appropriate protective equipment are available and used correctly.
- Hygiene measures are followed. 
- Emergency plans are prepared for unexpected exposure to biological risk factors.
- A list is kept of all employees who are or have been exposed to biological risk factors in infection
  risk group 3 or 4. 
- Serious injuries and illness that could be caused by the work shall be reported to the `Norwegian Labour
  Inspection Authority <https://www.arbeidstilsynet.no/en/contact/report/>`__.

5.3 Procurement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

5.4 Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Biological risk factors shall be registered:
