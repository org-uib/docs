:doc:`Norsk versjon </regler/Del-3-Personal-og-HMS/3.2-Helse-miljoe-og-sikkerhet/3.2.3-HMS-retningslinjer/Retningslinje-for-aarlig-kontroll-av-avtrekkskap/>`

Approved by the University Director 13.04.2023, archive reference 2007/10759.


1.Purpose
~~~~~~~~~

The aim of these guidelines is to ensure that employees and students at the University
of Bergen (UiB) do not incur injuries or illness when working with hazardous chemicals.


2. Scope
~~~~~~~~

The guidelines apply to fume hoods in the university's buildings and in rented areas
where agreed with the property owner. UiB has a responsibility towards its own users
to ensure that this is also carried out in buildings where UiB is a tenant. Microbiological
safety cabinets and other sterile benches are considered user equipment and must be looked
after by the individual unit


3. Responsibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Estate and Facilities Management division (EiA) is responsible for ensuring that the
annual inspection is carried out in a professionally responsible manner and in accordance
with these guidelines.

The line manager or line manager's representative is responsible for facilitating the
implementation of annual inspections and ensuring that unapproved fume hoods are rectified.

Employees and students are obliged to follow this guideline and report errors and deficiencies
in fume hoods.


4. Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EiA notifies line managers or line managers' representatives at relevant units well in
advance of the inspection being carried out.

The line manager or line manager's representative at the unit notifies applicable users. 
A contact person is appointed and reported to EiA before the inspection. The contact 
person ensures that relevant fume hoods are cleared and prepared for inspection.

Control shall include control of air volumes and air velocities, visual control of the
glass in the hatch of the fume hood, the hatch's raising and lowering function and 
control of alarms mounted on the facility.  The inspection shall be carried out annually.

After completion of the inspection, each fume hood is marked with: Date of inspection,
signature of the inspector and approved or not approved, depending on the result of the
inspection.

The results of the control are entered in an electronic overview, so that the function
of the fume hoods can be monitored over time. This information is stored by EiA, and 
EiA transmits the necessary information to relevant units. The information must be able
to be presented to the internal audit at the university and to external supervisory authorities.

If a fume hood is not approved, it is the line manager's responsibility, in cooperation
with the Estate and Facilities Management division, to ensure that the fume hood is repaired.
The Estate and Facilities Management division shall ensure proper functioning and follow up
the quality of UiB's area within available capacity and what is possible within given limits
and limitations. Defects in the fume hood itself are the responsibility of the user.
