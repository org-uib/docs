Ethical guidelines for relations between supervisors and students or candidates at the University of Bergen
===========================================================================================================

Determined by the University Board on 31.05.2012.

**1. Respect**

The supervisor and the student or candidate shall show respect for each
other. They shall not perform actions or make statements that might
infringe on the integrity or the dignity of the other.

**2. Asymmetry in the supervisory relationship**

The supervisor must be conscious that the supervisory relationship is
asymmetrical. The supervisor shall not use his or her academic knowledge
and authority to offend or subjugate, or to win personal or academic
advantage at the expense of the student or candidate. The student or
candidate is entitled to take up for discussion circumstances that he or
she believes are problematical, see point 6.

**3. Professionalism**

The supervisor and the student or candidate shall have a professional
relationship and they shall have no relations that are in conflict with
this professionalism. The supervisor has a specific responsibility not
to put the student or candidate into a vulnerable situation and/or
exploit such a situation. If a sexual relationship should arise between
the supervisor and the student or candidate, the formal supervisory
relationship shall cease.

**4. Trust and confidence**

The supervisor should be open and sensitive to any of the student's or
candidate's personal circumstances that might be of significance to the
supervisory relationship.

**5. Gifts and remuneration**

The supervisor shall not receive any remuneration or gifts of
significant value for the guidance given, other than what has been
agreed with the institution. As regards gifts of insignificant economic
value, the supervisor him or herself must assess whether the gift might
influence the supervisory relationship in any problematical manner.

**6. Conflicts between the supervisor and the student or candidate**

If the supervisor or the student or candidate believes that the
supervisory relationship has become problematical, the supervisor and/or
the student or candidate should consider changing, renegotiating or
concluding the supervisory relationship. The procedure for this shall be
described in the supervision contract that the supervisor and student or
candidate have signed or shall appear in the regulations of the
department or faculty in question. It shall always be possible to
contact the Head of Department if circumstances arise that are felt to
be problematical.

**7. The role and responsibilities of the department or faculty**

The University of Bergen has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring
that the student or candidate receives good, professional supervision
and guidance. All levels of the university leadership have a specific
responsibility if anything undesirable occurs in the supervisory
relationship, and the university leadership becomes aware of this.

**8. Intellectual property rights**

The supervisor and student or candidate shall treat each other's work
with respect and follow good reference practice on both sides. The
university's rules on handling employees' rights to the results of work
and research at the University of Bergen also apply to students.

**9. Termination of the supervisory relationship**

If for any reason the supervisory relationship is terminated before the
agreed time, both supervisor and student or candidate must make every
effort to ensure that this occurs in an orderly manner.
