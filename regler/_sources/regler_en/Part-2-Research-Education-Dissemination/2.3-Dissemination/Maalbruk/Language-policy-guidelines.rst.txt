:doc:`Norwegian version </regler/Del-2-Forskning-utdanning-og-formidling/2.3-Formidling/Maalbruk/Spraakpolitiske-retningslinjer>`

Adopted by the University Board 31 October 2019

The University of Bergen (UiB) is a knowledge and culture-bearing
institution, the academic activities of which are essential for
democracy and social development. The language policy guidelines will
help to implement UiB's strategy and strengthen the institution's
profile as a research-intensive, comprehensive university holding high
international academic quality.

The university shall have a distinct language policy and stand out as a
linguistic role model for education, culture and social life in Norway..
Norwegian is the main language. This means that the teaching language,
administrative language and the day-to-day working language is primarily
Norwegian. The principle of language clarity underlies the use of
language at UiB.

Moreover, the university is an international academic junction point
where publication and dissemination of knowledge is done in English.
This means that the university has a parallel language practice with
English as the most commonly used foreign language, although other
foreign languages are used as well.

The university's employees participate in international research but
also play a significant role in developing and safeguarding the
Norwegian language in their professional activities. Developing and
disseminating Norwegian academic language and terminology is an
important part of UiB's social mission.

Linguistic equality and tolerance are central principles at UiB. Nynorsk
shall have a prominent place in our academic activities. UiB has a
particular responsibility to ensure that Nynorsk remains an important
language in Norwegian higher education. The many users of Nynorsk at UiB
represent a great resource for the Nynorsk language and are very
important for Norwegian language development.

**General principles**

1. UiB shall have high linguistic quality in all communication and
dissemination.

2. The principle of language clarity shall be the foundation for written
communication at UiB.

3. Linguistic equality is an important value at UiB.

legislation.

b) UiB shall make provisions for employees and students who have Nynorsk
as their written language to use Nynorsk.

c) Nynorsk shall be used in published official circulars, announcements,
information material and the like on an equal basis and in approximately
the same scope as Bokmål.

4. UiB shall practise parallel use of language variants.

a) Norwegian is the main language, while at the same time we make
provisions for linguistic diversity. English is the primary foreign
language, but other foreign languages may also be relevant.

competence in Norwegian, English and other academically relevant foreign
languages to be able to communicate with students, employees and the
outside world in a proper and clear manner.

programmes.

Norwegian. The curricular literature in the compulsory courses shall be
in Norwegian if Norwegian textbooks exist that are as good as available
foreign language textbooks. Exceptions to this are studies where the
acquisition of skills in the foreign language are learning outcomes. Any
other exceptions must be justified by professional rationales and rooted
in the institution.

b) The teaching language in elective courses may be English.

8. UiB will work to make Norwegian and English terminology for the key
subject concepts in bachelor's programmes available in UiB's term base
and other relevant databases.

during the teaching of UiB's master's studies and PhD programmes. The
choice of language should reflect academic considerations.

10. Information about the programmes should be available in both
Norwegian and English.

11. The language of instruction in each course shall be clearly stated
in the course description.

Norwegian language for foreign students.

**Research and dissemination**

journals.

16. All PhD dissertations shall include a summary in both Norwegian and
English.

part of the dissemination of research-based knowledge is aimed at a
Norwegian-language audience.

18. UiB shall have a good and comprehensive offer of courses in the

units shall make provisions so that the employee's overall work tasks do
not preclude achieving this.
