description. Both genders must be represented in the expert committee,
unless it can be justified that such representation is not possible. In
the evaluation of applicants for professorial and associate professor
positions, only one of the experts may be employed by UiB. In relevant
subject areas and as far as possible, there should be at least one
expert from abroad. For other teaching or research positions, at least
one expert should be employed outside of UiB.</p>
<p>For the expert assessment of applicants for professorial positions, the
experts must have professorial competence or equivalent competence in
key areas of the discipline. For associate professor positions, at least
one of the experts must have professorial competence, and the others
competence at least at the associate professor level or equivalent
competence within key areas of the discipline.</p>
<p>For other teaching or research positions, postdoctoral positions and
fellowships, experts are appointed with professorial competence, or
competence at associate professor level, depending on the academic level
of the position. For appointment to a position as an associate professor
without requirement for a doctorate, up to two members of the committee
may hold a position as an associate professor. In special cases, a
post-doctoral fellow with expertise in key areas of the relevant
discipline may be used. Post-doctoral fellows with no required duties
may not be used. See also the special procedural rules for both PhD
positions (points 6.2.6 and 7.4) and post-doctoral positions (point
7.5).</p>
<p>In addition to the ordinary experts, in special cases one or more
special experts may be appointed to assess parts of the material
submitted by the applicants. Such special experts will submit individual
assessments as guidance for the ordinary experts.</p>
<p>The experts must not be related to or have such a connection to the
applicants that they will be rendered disqualified under the rules of
the Norwegian Public Administration Act. Similarly, there must be no
other special circumstances which are likely to undermine confidence in
the experts’ impartiality; for instance, due regard shall be paid to
whether the expert assessment could entail any special advantage, loss
or inconvenience for the expert or anyone with whom the expert has a
close personal association.</p>

<section id="mandate-for-the-expert-committee">
<h4>6.2.3 Mandate for the expert committee<a class="headerlink" href="#mandate-for-the-expert-committee" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>On the basis of the material submitted and the documented circumstances,
the expert committee will undertake assessment of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The applicants’ academic and/or artistic qualifications in accordance
with established international or national standards, and in relation to
the academic and/or artistic qualification requirements for the vacant
position as specified in the announcement text and job description.</p></li>
<li><p>Educational competence according to the requirements set out in the
regulations and the criteria established by UiB for the vacant post, as
specified in the announcement text and job description.</p></li>
<li><p>Other documented professional qualifications on the basis of the
requirements specified in the announcement text and job description.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The assessment must state who is qualified, and must describe the
academic distance between the qualified candidates, in addition to
ranking them. For appointment to a position as an associate professor,
applicants shall be assessed, but not ranked, on whether they meet the
requirements for a basic level of educational competence.</p>
<p>The assessment must be most extensive for the best-qualified applicants.
The assessment and ranking shall take into account the time span over
which the results have been achieved, and place most emphasis on
recently achieved results. For ordinary professor and associate
professor positions, academic qualifications will, unless otherwise
stated, be accorded weight ahead of other qualifications. Educational
qualifications will, unless otherwise stated in the announcement text,
be accorded higher weight than qualifications within the areas of
dissemination, administration and management.</p>
<p>If the announcement text is open for temporary employment in the
qualifying position with a view to qualification and permanent
employment, the expert committee shall express an opinion as to whether
the applicants have the academic capability to gain the necessary
qualifications within the stipulated period of temporary employment.</p>
<p>The committee must not express an opinion on issues of equality,
preferential rights, personal capability, or other conditions that do
not concern the applicants’ overall documented academic qualifications.</p>
<p>The experts shall normally work as a committee, but in some cases it may
be decided that the experts shall submit individual assessments. If
there is dissent within the committee, the reasons for this shall be
included in the statement.</p>
<p>The expert assessment must normally be ready within three months of the
expert committee’s receiving the necessary material, etc. If the
assessment cannot be delivered within this deadline, this should be
reported to the faculty and substantiated.</p>

<h4>6.3.2 Basis and evaluation criteria for recommendations<a class="headerlink" href="#basis-and-evaluation-criteria-for-recommendations" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The nomination is based on an academic evaluation according to the
requirements listed in the job posting and job description.</p>
<p>Interviews, the gathering of references, trial lectures or other tests
must also be conducted as a basis for the recommendation. The department
head or immediate supervisor of the position shall take part in
interviews. For trial lectures or other tests, the same arbiter shall
participate.</p>
<p>If any of the qualified applicants for a position state that they have a
disability that will require adaptation of the workplace or work
conditions, at least one of these applicants shall be called in for
interview, cf. Regulations of the Civil Service Act Section 6 (1).</p>
<p>According to civil service personnel policy guidelines, at least one
applicant with an immigrant background shall be called in for interview.
This is conditional on the applicant being eligible for the position.
This applies preferably for immigrants from Europe other than EU/EFTA,
Asia (incl. Turkey), Africa, South- and Central America and Oceania
except Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The recommendation must include an assessment of the applicant’s
personal suitability for the position. This suitability assessment for
the position in question will necessarily be based largely on subjective
discretion. If personal suitability as a criterion is to be attributed
decisive weight in the ranking of otherwise qualified applicants, the
nominating authority must ensure that this has a justifiable, factual
basis for evaluation. This entails that an interview must be conducted
and that references must be gathered. In addition, the reasons must be
made clear in the recommendation as to why an otherwise well-qualified
applicant’s personal suitability is deemed to be inferior to that of
other applicants. In any case, this criterion must be sufficiently
elucidated. Personal qualities that are given weight must be relevant to
the work that is to be performed.</p>
<p>For positions demanding educational qualifications, a separate
assessment is to be conducted as to whether the applicants fulfil these
requirements.</p>

recommendation. An applicant also has the right to seek information as
to whether there is any dissent among the members of the nominating
authority, and if so, how many votes each of the recommended candidates
received.</p>
<p>An applicant is not entitled to inspect the document containing the
rationale that the nominating authority has submitted as the basis for

new factual information or statements of significance to the case.</p>
<p>In addition to the recommendation, an applicant has the right of access
to inspect parts of the reports from interviews, trial lectures etc.,
pursuant to Section 18 of the Norwegian Public Administration Act.</p>
<p>A copy of the recommendation and the statement of the expert assessor(s)
is sent to the UiB’s Equal Opportunities Committee, and the latter has
an opportunity to make comments within 3 working days. The statement of
the committee must accompany the case documents sent to the appointing

<p>Appointment is made on the basis of the recommendation. The appointing
body must assess whether or not the recommendation is built on a
defensible, factual foundation based on the qualification criteria and
needs presented in the announcement text and job description, the expert
assessor(s) report and personal suitability etc.</p>
<p>If a member of a selection board wishes to employ an applicant who has
not been recommended, a written assessment of the applicant shall be
obtained from the person making the recommendation, cf. Civil Service
Act Section 6 (3). The selection board may then choose to employ one of
those who have been recommended or an applicant on whom they have
obtained a written assessment.</p>
<p>If an applicant with an external preferential right fulfils the
professional and personal requirements for the position, that person
should be employed, unless the exclusions in the Regulations of the
Civil Service Act Section 8 apply. The preferential right does not
apply, inter alia, for employment in positions as professor, docent,
associate professor or senior lecturer, unless the employee has been
terminated from such a position.</p>
<p>If the appointing body is in doubt as to whether the expert assessor(s)’
judgement is adequate and defensible, the appointing body shall do
whatever is necessary to clarify and, where appropriate, correct the
dissension, but shall not itself undertake an expert assessment. The
appointing body can do this through the following procedure:</p>

<p>Appointment to the appointments board for temporary academic positions
takes place by case documents being sent to the members of the
appointments board, and each member submits a separate statement of
opinion. Finally, the chairperson of the appointments board submits
his/her statement. A meeting is held when one member of the appointments
board so requires, or when there is dissent among the members of the
appointments board.</p>
<p>Members of the appointing body who have participated in the nominating
authority’s consideration of the case or who have been members of the
expert committee should relinquish their seats in the appointing body
during the appointing body’s consideration of the case.</p>
<p>The appointing body has a quorum when at least half of the members are

votes, the appointing body’s chairperson has a double vote.</p>
<p>The appointing body’s formal decisions are recorded in the minutes,
where it should be shown how the individual members voted. The members
have an opportunity to have their objections/points of view put on
record in the minutes. The objection must be put on record before the
appointing body has finished considering the case in a formal meeting.</p>
<p>The selection board may decide that a trial period should not apply, or

<p>Appointments for a fixed term, secondary post may be made. The
fixed-term appointments can range from two to six years. No limitation
has been placed on the number of times a person can be appointed to a
secondary post on a fixed-term basis.</p>
<p>One prerequisite for appointment to a secondary post at UiB is that the
appointee is primarily in the employ of an employer with whom UiB wishes
to collaborate.</p>
<p>An expert assessment must be conducted according to the job description
that is adapted to the academic, educational and/or artistic competence
required for the temporary position. In special cases, the Faculty Board
may decide that the requirement to an expert assessment may be waived.
For employees in temporary secondary posts at UiB who have achieved
competence certification for an II-position and who are applying for a
vacant full-time position, a new assessment must be undertaken focusing
on the ordinary academic, educational and/or artistic qualifications
required for the vacant position.</p>

<h3><strong>7.2 Combined positions</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#combined-positions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A combined position is a permanent primary position and a permanent
secondary post of up to 20 per cent of a full-time position that,
according to an agreement between different employers, are linked
together in such a way that the employee who holds the primary position
is also required to have the secondary post. Combined positions differ
from other job combinations in that the secondary post is treated as a
supplement to the employee’s main salary and is not included in the
overall job percentage.</p>
<p>The agreement should clarify the employers’ obligations in terms of
employees in combined positions, and adaptation and financing of the
research- and teaching functions that employees in combined positions
are expected to attend to. Provisions are to be made for adapting each
of the work conditions so that work duties in both positions are
attended to.</p>
<p>Combined positions must be advertised at the same time and jointly by
the primary and secondary employers.</p>
<p>Applicants must fulfil the employment conditions and competence
requirements for both positions. In special cases, the Faculty Board can
decide that the requirements to an ordinary expert assessment for
secondary posts at UiB may be waived. For employees in secondary posts
at UiB who have achieved limited competence certification and are
applying for a different permanent position or promotion, a new
assessment must be conducted focusing on the ordinary academic,
educational and/or artistic qualifications that are required.</p>
<p>If one employer wishes to appoint an applicant that the other employer
does not find to be qualified, the position is advertised again. Prior
to appointment to the primary position, the selection board for the
secondary post must approve the appointment.</p>
<p>Employees in combined positions shall observe both parties’ rules
regarding safeguarding of confidential information.</p>
<p>Applications for/notification of holiday leave, illness and other
absence must be submitted to both employers.</p>
<p>Upon expiry of employment in the primary position, employment in the
secondary post also expires. Independent termination of the secondary
post takes place in conformity with the regular rules on termination in

(3), exemptions may be made from the Civil Service Act Section 3 to
Section 7 for the employment of personnel who are to perform externally
financed assignments.</p>
<p>Externally-financed personnel are employees who are hired to perform
assignments that are fully or mainly financed by revenue recognition of
funds from another source. In order for financing to be called external,
the funds must be transferred from a source that is not in such a
relationship with UiB that it would be natural to consider the financing
as internal. Financing of assignments via its own Ministry is not
regarded as external financing. However, the transfer of funds from
another Ministry would be considered external financing. The employee is
paid from assignment funds transferred from another source. If UiB
accepts a portion of the expenses of the assignment out of self-interest
or as support, this will not affect the assessment if UiB’s own
contribution is limited or immaterial.</p>
<p>The work must essentially apply to the assignment to be performed.
Therefore, the employee should not perform regular, ongoing work tasks.</p>
<p>In the case of UiB, the possibilities for exceptions to the regulation
for externally financed assignments should be practiced as follows:</p>
