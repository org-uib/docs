<section id="introduction">
<h2>1. Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Employees are entitled to a thoroughly sound working environment and
shall not be subjected to bullying, harassment or other improper
conduct.</p>
<p>The University of Bergen as an employer has a duty to ensure that this
right is complied with, and shall through active work ensure a good,
safe psychosocial working environment.</p>
<p>These guidelines shall help prevent bullying and harassment in the
workplace, provide information on the employees’ right and duty to
report and ensure proper handling of such cases.</p>
</section>
<section id="definitions">
<h2>2. Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#definitions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Bullying, harassment and improper conduct</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bullying is defined as actions, omissions or utterances that are
repetitive, systematic, and persistent, and that have the purpose or
effect of being offensive, intimidating, hostile, degrading or
humiliating, and where the victim has difficulty in defending
her/himself because the course of events is characterised by an
actual or perceived power imbalance between the parties (cf.
Einarsen, Hoel, Zapf, &amp; Cooper, 2011; Olweus, 1993).</p></li>
<li><p>Harassment and improper conduct are defined as acts, omissions or
utterances that have the purpose or effect of being offensive,
intimidating, hostile, degrading or humiliating (Equality and
Anti-Discrimination Act, Section 13).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Harassment and improper conduct can have various forms. These can be
single actions as well as repeated and systematic actions, and these can
be both direct (e.g. aggressive or sexually charged behavior) and
indirect (e.g. social exclusion). In some cases the negative treatment
of employees may take the form of sexual harassment or bullying, without
limiting the term of harassment and improper conduct to this.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment means any form of unwanted sexual attention that is
intended to be effect of being offensive, intimidating, hostile,
degrading, humiliating, or troublesome.</p>
<p>Discrimination is always considered improper conduct (cf. Equality and
Anti-Discrimination Act). The same applies to retaliation against people
who have reported improper conduct in accordance with the guidelines.</p>
<p>In the following, all references to bullying and harassment also include
improper conduct.</p>
</section>
<section id="prevention">
<h2>3. Prevention<a class="headerlink" href="#prevention" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Preventing bullying and harassment is part of the systematic HSE work.
It involves mapping the work environment, assessing the risk of bullying
and harassment, drawing up plans and prioritizing measures, and
implementing measures to reduce the risk factors.</p>
<p>Managers are responsible for ensuring the mapping and risk assessment of
the working environment to prevent and seek to preclude employees from
being subjected to bullying and harassment and shall take necessary
measures to reduce the risk of bullying and harassment occurring.</p>
<p>Employees shall participate in the design of measures to prevent
bullying and harassment and shall adhere to routines and measures
against bullying and harassment.</p>
<p>Managers, safety delegates and union representatives must have expertise
in the prevention and management of bullying and harassment.</p>
<p>Managers are expected to indicate clear boundaries for what constitutes
unacceptable behaviour in daily activities, keep discussions objective,
and to not accept personal attacks or ridicule, as well as avoid
negative mention of employees and comply with the duty of
confidentiality in respect of personal matters.</p>
</section>
<section id="notification">
<h2>4. Notification<a class="headerlink" href="#notification" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Any employee who feels that they are being subjected to bullying,
harassment or other improper conduct by one or more work colleagues
should always notify their immediate manager, possibly to the safety
delegate. If the employee’s immediate leader is part of the case, the
matter should be reported to a higher level manager.</p>
<p>Any employee who becomes aware of bullying, harassment or other improper
conduct in the workplace must notify the manager, possible the safety
delegate, as soon as possible. If the manager is part of the case, the
matter should be reported to a higher level manager.</p>
<p>Employees can contact the occupational health service (BHT) for advice
and assistance.</p>
<p>Employees can also contact their union representatives for assistance
with the case.</p>
<p>When a safety delegate becomes aware of the occurrence of bullying,
harassment or other improper conduct in the workplace, the safety
delegate must immediately notify the manager or a higher level manager,
if the manager is part of the case.</p>
<p>Bullying and harassment in the workplace shall be reported in accordance
with the <a class="reference internal" href="../3.1.6-Notification-Whistleblowing/Guidelines-for-whistleblowing-at-the-University-of-Bergen.html"><span class="doc">Guidelines for whistleblowing at the University of Bergen</span></a></p>
</section>
<section id="handling">
<h2>5. Handling<a class="headerlink" href="#handling" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>When a manager is notified of a case of bullying, harassment or other
improper conduct, or becomes aware of such her/himself, she or he must
immediately seek to obtain an overview of the case and ensure that the
case is handled properly. In this context, reference is made to the
procedure for notification in UiB’s <a class="reference internal" href="../3.1.6-Notification-Whistleblowing/Guidelines-for-whistleblowing-at-the-University-of-Bergen.html"><span class="doc">Guidelines for whistleblowing at the University of Bergen</span></a>
The manager must check that she/he is not involved in the case
her/himself, as far as this is possible. If she/he is involved, the case
must be dealt with at a higher managerial level.</p>
<p>Managers can seek advice and assistance on how to handle the case from
the Division of HR. The occupational health service can also provide
advice in these kinds of cases.</p>
<p>Managers have a responsibility to safeguard all the parties involved in
these kinds of cases and refer employees to the occupational health
service if necessary. Retaliation against people who have notified in
accordance with the guidelines (whistleblowers) is forbidden.</p>
<section id="investigation">
<h3>Investigation<a class="headerlink" href="#investigation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>It will often be natural to initiate the investigation by conducting
individual interviews with the person or people who have reported
improper conduct, the parties involved, and others who may be able to
provide information about the case.</p>
<p>Some advice regarding the interviews:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Inform the involved parties about their right to include an employee
representative / adviser in the invitation to a meeting. At the same
time, inform who the employer has requested to attend the meeting</p></li>
<li><p>Start by clarifying the purpose and premises of the interview.</p></li>
<li><p>Be prepared for the fact that these kinds of interviews may be
emotionally distressing for the employee.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not be biased. Be concerned with listening to your employees.
Avoid being influenced by the first information you receive.
Different versions can be equally correct/wrong</p></li>
<li><p>Make a memo from the interviews. To avoid any misunderstandings, the
employee should be allowed to review and, if necessary, revise the
memos from their interview</p></li>
<li><p>Trust and confidentiality are particularly important in such
contexts. When disseminating information received, one should avoid
referring to who has said what, but focus on what was communicated</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After the interviews, a summary of the case must be prepared and it must
be considered whether further information retrieval is needed in order
to investigate the case.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Once the case has been enlightened as well as possible, a conclusion
must be reached as to whether someone is being – or has been – subjected
to bullying, harassment or other improper conduct. The involved parties
must be informed about the conclusion.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="follow-up">
<h2>6. Follow-up<a class="headerlink" href="#follow-up" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If the conclusion is that one or more employees are being subjected to
bullying, harassment or other improper conduct by other employees, the
matter must be rectified such that the employee(s) is ensured a
thoroughly sound working environment.</p>
<p>At such a conclusion the manager, together with the Division of HR, must
assess whether there are grounds for sanctions against one or more of
the parties involved in the case.</p>
<p>In addition, steps must be taken to prevent the improper conduct from
happening again.</p>
<p>Failure to deal with these kinds of cases properly can be notified as
censurable conditions in accordance with the <a class="reference internal" href="../3.1.6-Notification-Whistleblowing/Guidelines-for-whistleblowing-at-the-University-of-Bergen.html"><span class="doc">Guidelines for whistleblowing at the University of Bergen</span></a></p>
<p>In order to prevent new cases of bullying and harassment, continuous
preventive work is important as part of the systematic HSE work.</p>
