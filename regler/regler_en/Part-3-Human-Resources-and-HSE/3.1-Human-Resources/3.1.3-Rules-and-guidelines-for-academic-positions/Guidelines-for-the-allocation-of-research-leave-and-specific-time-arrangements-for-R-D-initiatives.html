<section id="purpose">
<h1>1. Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Research leave is allocated every seven years and will contribute to
strengthening and developing research, innovation and research-based
teaching for scientific employees with research competence. Research
leave must be arranged for the purpose of continuous specialisation in
the employee’s own research, new product development or establishment of
research collaborations with other research environments, nationally or
internationally.</p>
<p>The option of research and development work focusing on mobility and
career development can be granted through specific time arrangements for
R&amp;D initiatives, c.f. item 3.</p>

R&amp;D initiatives.</p>
</section>
<section id="accrual-of-research-leave">
<h2>2.2 Accrual of research leave<a class="headerlink" href="#accrual-of-research-leave" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The accrual period for research leave of one year is a total of six
years’ service as a professor or associate professor in a minimum 50%
position or three years for a six-month research leave period. If
indicated by special circumstances, applications for shorter research
leave may be granted with a corresponding shortening of the accrual
period. A new accrual period will commence upon completion of the
research leave.</p>
<p>Research leave are allocated subject to the employee having carried out
ordinary research, teaching and administrative duties during the accrual
period or having managed major research projects. Statutory paid leave
and periods as a salaried employee representative are considered equal
to ordinary duties.</p>
<p>Those entitled to apply and who hold office/employment as, for example,
rector, pro-rector, deputy rector, dean, pro-dean, deputy dean and head
of institute will accrue one year’s research leave upon completion of
the period. Research leave of two years can be granted for multiple
consecutive periods in such roles.</p>
<p>Those entitled to apply and salaried employee representatives with a job
percentage of 50% of more will accrue a research leave of one year
following four years of consecutive service.</p>
<p>By special resolution, the University Board may determine shorter
accrual periods for research leave for offices/employees with especially
weighty academic/administrative tasks at or outside of the University of
Bergen.</p>

<h2>2.4. Allocation of research leave<a class="headerlink" href="#allocation-of-research-leave" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Upon the expiration of the application deadline, the institute will
prepare recommendations based on the application received.</div>
<div class="line">The recommendation may cover:</div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>submitted research plans, research collaborations with international
research environments and interdisciplinary projects</p></li>
<li><p>results from previous research leave and special research efforts
during the accrual period</p></li>
<li><p>prolonged heavy loads in teaching, committee work and other

</ul>
<p>The faculty will process the research leave applications on the basis of
the recommendations from the institute. The faculties will decide on the
applications and allocate research leave, as well as determining any
temporary cover expenses.</p>
<p>If, for reasons relating to teaching, it would not be possible to
allocate research leave to all applicants with sufficient time accrued,
a prioritisation of applications must be performed. The recommendation
of the head of institute will form the basis for such prioritisation.</p>
<p>Applicants who are not awarded research leave for reasons relating to
teaching will be prioritised for research leave in the next application
round. In such cases, the period of the postponement will be included in
the next accrual period.</p>
<p>Rejected applications must be justified. Upon appeal from the applicant,
a rejection may be overturned by the superior authority, which is the
rector if the faculty board is acting as the allocating authority.</p>
<p>The faculty may delegate the allocation of research leave to the
institute.</p>
</section>
<section id="implementation-of-research-leave">
<h2>2.5 Implementation of research leave<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-of-research-leave" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The research leave must be implemented in accordance with the purpose of
the scheme. As a general rule, the leave must be implemented in
connection with the accrued period.</p>
<p>If the leave is not implemented immediately upon completion of accrual,
the faculties may grant a postponement. The postponement period will
then be included in the next accrual period up to a maximum of four
semesters.</p>
<p>If the leave is interrupted due to long-term illness or childbirth, an
agreement can be reached so that the rest of the leave can be
implemented at a later date.</p>
<p>During the leave, the employee shall be exempt from teaching duties,
clinical and administrative duties, as well as attendance requirements
at their ordinary place of work. During the leave, the employee will be
considered to be on paid leave outside of the University of Bergen.
Normal holiday periods should be implemented during the leave.</p>
<p>The person to whom a research leave has been granted has a duty to
implement the plan that formed the basis for the application. It is not
permitted to carry out work, assignments, teaching, exams, tutoring,
office or anything else that could prevent or delay the implementation
of the plans without consent from the allocating authority.</p>
<p>It is not normally possible to implement a research leave during a
fixed-term/elected period.</p>
</section>
<section id="reporting-on-research-leave">
<h2>2.6 Reporting on research leave<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-on-research-leave" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The faculty expects to receive a written report within two months of
conclusion of the research leave. Rules on reporting are provided by
each faculty.</p>
