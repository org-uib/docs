<section id="employees-in-particularly-independent-posts">
<h4><strong>3.2 Employees in particularly independent posts</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#employees-in-particularly-independent-posts" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The Working Environment Act’s «particularly independent posts» are
characterised by those holding these posts being «independent» in terms
of how and when they organise and execute their tasks. The employee can
decide how to prioritise among their tasks and decide when and how to
perform their work.</p>
<p>Research entails significant academic independence, in the form of the
freedom to choose questions, methods, the publication of research
results, etc. Furthermore, the employee manages the academic preparation
of their own teaching. If the employee manages the bulk of their tasks,
then this indicates that the employee is particularly independent.</p>
<p>If fixed hours, such as teaching, supervision at fixed hours,
administration or other managed tasks comprise the bulk of the FTE, this
indicates that the employee is not particularly independent.</p>
<p><strong>3.2.1 Posts that are normally particularly independent</strong></p>
<p>The general principle is that employees in combined academic positions
at UiB are to spend equal time on research and teaching. The basic
characteristics of the position require that dissemination and
administration comprise a limited share of the tasks, and usually no
more than 10 per cent of working hours. Employees can make their own
decisions about the content and system of research, teaching and
dissemination in accordance with the provisions of the Act relating to
Universities and University Colleges regarding academic freedom and
responsibility.</p>
<p>Based on the terms used in the Working Environment Act and the entity’s
organisation of the positions, the following UiB positions shall
generally be considered particularly independent:</p>
<p>Professor Position code 1013 and 1404</p>
<p>Associate Professor Position code 1011</p>
<p>Assistant Professor Position code 1010</p>
<p>This also applies to teaching positions that have formal qualifications
as the main objective and that include a limited share of required
duties:</p>
<p>Postdoctoral Fellow Position code 1352</p>
<p>Doctoral Research Fellow Position code 1017 and 1378</p>
<p>Specialist Fellow Position code 1476</p>
<p>Employees in these positions normally have a clear and obvious
independence in terms of how and when their work tasks are organised and
executed. Unless the employer confirms in writing that a specific
employee is not to be included, employees in the above-mentioned
positions are legally considered particularly independent.</p>
<p>Employees in particularly independent posts are not subject to the
requirement to keep accounts of their hours.</p>
<p><strong>3.2.2 Employees in positions that must be individually assessed in relation to the «particularly independent post» concept</strong></p>
<p>Employees in the following position groups will have varying types of
tasks and work may be organised in different ways:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Associate Professor Position code 1198</div>
<div class="line">Assistant Professor Position code 1009</div>
<div class="line">Dental Instructor Position code 1015 and 1353</div>
<div class="line">Dental Specialist Position code 1016</div>
<div class="line">Research Assistant Position code 1018, 1019 and 1020</div>
<div class="line">Researcher Position code 1108, 1109, 1110 and1183 (temporary in
externally funded research projects)</div>
</div>
<p>Whether individual employees in these positions fall under the legal
definition of «particularly independent» must be assessed by a
supervisor based on the specific individual circumstances.</p>
<p>Individual assessments must be based on the typical characteristics of
the category of the position in question. The individual element will
relate to variations in the actual work for each employee, as compared
to the typical criteria for the position category.</p>
<p>If the conclusion is that the employee is not considered particularly
independent, the employee will be covered by the ordinary provisions in
the Working Environment Act about working hours, as supplemented by the
provisions of the Basic Agreement. This includes the requirement in
section 10-7 of the Working Environment Act that «an account shall be
kept of the hours worked by each employee.» If the employee can vary the
timing of their hours (flexible hours) themself, the employee must keep
an updated account of the hours worked per day. The account must be
available to a supervisor on request or be submitted regularly to a
supervisor (for example monthly).</p>
<p><strong>3.2.3 Other legal effects of being in a senior or particularly independent post</strong></p>
<p>Employees in senior and particularly independent posts have the same
legal status as employees in other positions with regard to the
employer’s management prerogatives and the employer’s right to manage,
allocate and control the work. The content of the employment contract is
also the same in that the employees are required to work 37.5 hours a
week. The positions are also subject to framework in the Basic Agreement
regarding working hours, in part because working hours shall as far as
possible be between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday. However,
this must be understood as referencing the working hours governed by
someone other than the employee, such as the timing of classes set by
the employer. Otherwise, the starting point is that employees in
particularly independent posts themselves decide when to work the hours
they regulate themselves. The employee is also required to comply with
the times set for teaching, project participation, meetings or other
activities in which the timing is governed by the employer. In general,
the employee is required to be present at their ordinary place of work
unless there are academic reasons for working elsewhere.</p>

<h2><strong>Part II. Registration of overtime</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#part-ii-registration-of-overtime" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The overtime framework is stipulated in section 10-6 of the Working
Environment Act and section 13 of the Basic Agreement.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Section 13(1) of the Basic Agreement requires that «overtime work must
be imposed and controllable and must be limited in accordance with the
requirements in the Working Environment Act.»</div>
<div class="line">Section 10-6(1) of the Working Environment Act includes a caveat that
«work in excess of agreed working hours must not take place except in
cases when there is an exceptional and time-limited need for it.»</div>
</div>
<p>Regardless of the organisation of an employee’s hours, the general
conditions are that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>overtime can only be imposed in extraordinary circumstances. In other
words, it cannot be used to cover a permanent need for labour power.</p></li>
<li><p>overtime must be explicitly imposed by a supervisor, who must also be
able to control and confirm that the overtime work has been
completed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>1 Overtime for employees subject to chapter 10 of the Working Environment Act</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#overtime-for-employees-subject-to-chapter-10-of-the-working-environment-act" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>For employees subject to chapter 10 of the Working Environment Act, the
limits of daily, weekly and yearly overtime work are stipulated in
section 10-6 of the Act. Overtime work shall not exceed 10 hours in a
seven-day period, 25 hours in four consecutive weeks, or 200 hours a
year.</p>
<p>The Act assumes a 40-hour week, but state employees have a 37.5-hour
work week pursuant to collective agreements. This means that the weekly
overtime limits can be extended by 2.5 hours. However, this does not
mean that employees are automatically able to work an extra 130 hours
overtime a year on top of the 200-hour limit («saving» the extra quota).
The expanded quota only applies week by week, i.e. to the difference
between 40 hours and 37.5 hours. The annual number of «extra hours» will
thus be determined based on the actual weekly overtime for each
employee.</p>
<p>Total work hours (regular hours and overtime) cannot exceed 13 hours in
any 24-hour period.</p>

<h4><strong>1.2 Employees with variable hours</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>If the employer requires an employee who is subject to the Special
agreement on flexible hours in the state to work beyond ordinary working
hours, this must be compensated by overtime pay pursuant to section
13(2) and 13(3) of the Basic Agreement. The employee cannot be required
to work flexible hours outside of ordinary working hours.</p>
<p>Each employee must register imposed overtime on an overtime form and in
the form for registering flexible hours. Imposed overtime that according
to the agreement is to be compensated by time off and additional hours
in the flexible hours calculations must be kept separate. The accounts
must be available to a supervisor on request or be submitted to a
supervisor regularly (e.g monthly).</p>

<div class="line">In its comments to section 13(4) of the Basic Agreement, the Ministry
of Education and Research has assumed that the employees in such cases</div>

<div class="line">overtime work. If these prerequisites are not met, overtime
compensation cannot be paid … The immediate supervisor must confirm

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The provision in section 13(4) of the Basic Agreement does not require
