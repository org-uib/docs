<h2>1. Purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The University of Bergen (UiB) wants to ensure good cooperation between line managers and safety
representatives. This is done by setting aside sufficient time at all levels to carry out the
safety representative role in a prudent manner. Regular meetings between safety representatives
and line managers will facilitate active cooperation between line managers and safety
representatives in the systematic health, safety and environment (HSE) work at UiB.</p>

<section id="organisation">
<h3>7.1 Organisation<a class="headerlink" href="#organisation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Within his/her area of responsibility, the line manager must:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Ensure facilitation and cooperation between the line manager and safety representative.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow up any coordination agreements with other employers, cf. the Internal Control
Regulations section 6.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the safety representative has sufficient HSE expertise to function in the
position.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Within their area of responsibility, safety representatives shall:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be familiar with the guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the employer fulfils its responsibilities pursuant to regulatory requirements
and the University’s internal rules.</p></li>
<li><p>Participate in the planning and implementation of the systematic HSE work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the safety representative must be familiar with the provisions concerning the
safety representative’s duty of secrecy (cf. the Regulations concerning Organisation,
Management and Employee Participation section 3-17).</p>
<p>Within their area of responsibility, deputy safety representatives shall:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Be familiar with the guidelines and be able to step in if the safety representative is
prevented from performing his/her duties. In those situations where the deputy safety
representative assumes responsibility, the same rules apply to the deputy safety
representative as for the safety representative.</p></li>
<li><p>Be invited to participate in relevant meetings in order to be able to fulfill the position.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>UCSR and CSR are also responsible for coordinating the safety representatives’ activities
within their occupational health and safety areas, cf. the Working Environment Act section
6-1 (3), and the Regulations concerning Organisation, Management and Employee Participation
section 3-5.</p>

<section id="implementation">
<h3>7.2 Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Start-up meeting</strong></p>
<p>In the case of a new safety representative and/or line manager, a start-up meeting must be
held to initiate and ensure good cooperation between the line manager and safety representative.</p>
<p><strong>Regular meetings between line management and safety services</strong></p>
<p>The line manager must ensure and facilitate regular meetings between the safety representative
and line manager. Safety representatives, deputy safety representatives and line managers must
meet at least every three months. Minutes must be kept in meetings between the line manager and
safety representative.</p>
<p>The line managers and safety representative must plan, carry out and follow up annual mappings
of the physical and psychosocial working environment, and other measures that have an impact on
the working environment within the safety representative’s area, also during change and readjustment
processes. The line manager and safety representative conduct annual HSE reporting cf. Guidelines
for annual review of the systematic health, environment and safety work (internal control).</p>
<p>The regular meetings between the line manager and safety representative must facilitate good
dialogue and exchange of information on the working environment situation of the area in question.
If special circumstances arise between the regular meetings that may affect the working environment,
the line manager must summon a meeting as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The chief safety representatives take part in the management’s review of the annual HSE report for
the various main occupational health and safety areas.</p>
<p><strong>Time to perform the duties of safety representative</strong></p>
<p>The line manager and safety representative shall ensure that the safety representative is afforded
sufficient time to perform his/her duties. The parties must jointly consider any consequences the
position may have for the safety representative’s ordinary tasks and consider specific solutions.
This should be done at the beginning of the safety representative period.</p>
<p>Just as SR, CSR must be given sufficient time to perform his/her duties. For CSR partial release
from his/her ordinary duties is appropriate, where the scope of release may vary according to the
size of and activities at the unit. UCSR at UiB has 100% release from duties, and for deputy UCSR
there is partial release.</p>
<p>If unexpected circumstances arise that entail that safety representative work must be carried out
beyond ordinary work hours pursuant to the Working Environment Act section 10-4, it shall be
compensated as overtime, cf. the Working Environment Act section 6-5 (3). If unexpected circumstances
arise that require action on the part of the safety representative, the safety representative is
entitled to leave the workplace. If this happens, the safety representative must inform the line manager.</p>
