<h2>2 Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#scope" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>

at UiB, hereafter called users.</p></li>
<li><p>All use of UiB’s ICT systems.</p></li>

<li><p>Private and third-party ICT equipment connected to UiB’s ICT infrastructure
(e.g. network) regardless of its purpose.</p></li>
</ul>
