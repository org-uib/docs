<h1>Regulation on handling employees’ rights to the results of work and research at the University of Bergen<a class="headerlink" href="#regulation-on-handling-employees-rights-to-the-results-of-work-and-research-at-the-university-of-bergen" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Changes in the Norwegian Act relating to Universities and University
Colleges in 2002 entailed assigning institutions the mandatory task of
contributing towards research-based innovation and creativity, in
addition to their primary tasks of research, teaching and dissemination
of information. Moreover, there are increasing expectations that
research results, in addition to application for purely academic
purposes, shall also be utilized for commercial ends. This has
actualized the issue of who has the right to use research and work
results: it is necessary to clarify rights ownership policy and to
design legislation to regulate the question of rights to intellectual
property.</p>
<p>The University Board adopted the “Rights Policy at the University of
Bergen” in June 2009 (agenda item 68/09) The rights policy provides a
general framework for handling the issue of rights ownership linked with
various categories of research-based work results. The present
regulation is rooted in rights policy and provides supplementary
provisions for the handling of intellectual property rights pertaining
to research and work results.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The purpose of this regulation is to clarify the extent of the
university’s right to use or exploit research and work results
produced by university employees. The the regulation governing the
handling intellectual property rights shall contribute towards:</div>
<div class="line">• ensuring that researchers and institutions’ academic freedom is
supported and safeguarded</div>
<div class="line">• increasing awareness of the importance of the values that research
results represent</div>
<div class="line">• raising awareness of the meaning of safeguarding and protecting the
research results that are produced</div>
<div class="line">• creating unambiguous and predictable frameworks for internal and
external collaborative partners</div>
<div class="line">• increasing the opportunities for efficient and expedient
exploitation of research results in academia, society and business
life.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Point of departure</strong></p>
<p>In general, the person who creates a result out of research or work is
the owner of the rights to the result unless otherwise established by
provisions pursuant to statutes, contract or this regulation. The rules
herein regulate the cases in which the university, as the employer, has
ownership rights to these research- and work-related results.</p>
<p>If the university enters into agreements with a third party concerning
collaboration on research or research funding, including contributory
and contracted work, the employee who participates in such projects must
conform with any property rights dispositions laid down in such
agreements.</p>
<p>In cases where the university has such rights, the institution must see
to it that the results are used in the best interests of society. This
can be through commercialization or making the results publicly
available wherever possible.</p>
<p><strong>Whom does the regulation encompass?</strong></p>
<p>The guidelines apply for all employees of UoB.</p>
<p>Students own the results they generate from their studies or stay at the
university, unless otherwise agreed. Upon request from the student, and
if the university finds it expedient after the results have been
evaluated for commercial potential by Bergen Teknologioverføring AS (BTO
- technology transfer), the university can transfer the innovation
rights for commercial exploitation. In this voluntary transfer of rights
for commercialization, the distribution of rights is regulated by a
separate agreement between the student-innovator and the university via
BTO. In the case of results that are produced by one or more students
and one or more employees together (joint ownership), the university has
the right to take control of the employees’ share of the co-owned IPR,
in accordance with legislation, any existing agreements and the present
regulation. Students who are employed at the university, for example in
a project position or as a research assistant, are subject to the same
treatment as any other employees in terms of results derived from tasks
performed as part of their work duties under the terms of the employment
contract.</p>
<p>For guest researchers, the question of intellectual property rights
should be clarified by separate agreement.</p>
<p>If an employee has more than one employer, the employers must come to a
consensus as to how their rights are to be divided among themselves.</p>
<p><strong>What does the regulation encompass?</strong></p>
<p>The present regulation applies only to results achieved in conjunction
with the employee’s contractual employment at the university. Although
the regulation encompasses all research and work results, this does not
mean that the university will demand control of all rights to results.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Research and work results can generally be grouped in the following
categories (the list is not exhaustive):</div>
<div class="line">• Non-fictional productions (such as monographs, textbooks, scientific
articles and doctoral theses) and other literary and artistic works</div>
<div class="line">• Teaching and communications materials (such as oral lectures,
different types of presentations, written assignments, instructional
videos and digital teaching programmes)</div>
<div class="line">• Computer programs</div>
<div class="line">• Catalogues and databases (designing of various systematized
collections of information or data)</div>
<div class="line">• Inventions</div>
<div class="line">• Physical materials – all material products (organic, non-organic and
biological materials) – including substances, organisms, cultivated
growths and materials</div>
<div class="line">• Administrative works (such as fact-finding reports, consultative
statements, proposed curriculum/syllabus and teaching plans)</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Further information on the handling of rights to various results</strong></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Non-fictional works</em></div>
<div class="line">As a rule, the employees themselves can decide what can be done with
their own non-fictional works (such as copying, storage, alteration
and publication of monographs, textbooks, academic articles and
doctoral theses) In specially justified cases, the university may
obtain a non-exclusive, limited right to use such rights. This applies
particularly in cases where the university has spent or is investing
significant resources in developing the materials. The issue of
whether the university is to have such rights must be clarified in
advance.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Other literature and works of art</em></div>
<div class="line">As a rule, the employees themselves can decide what can be done (such
as copying, storage, alteration and publication) with their own
literary production or works of art. In specially justified cases, the
university may obtain a non-exclusive, limited right to use such
results. This applies particularly in cases where the university has
spent or is investing significant resources in developing these.. (The
issue of whether the university is to have such rights must be
clarified in advance.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Teaching and communication materials</em></div>
<div class="line">As a rule, the employees themselves can decide what can be done (such
as copying, storage, alteration and publication) with their own
teaching and communication materials.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The university has the right to use such materials if:</div>
<div class="line">• they are designed for general use (standardized materials)</div>
<div class="line">• the university has contributed dedicated developmental support in
the form of financing, technical assistance or reduced teaching duties</div>
<div class="line">• the university has specially asked an employee to develop these
teaching materials</div>
<div class="line">• the university has entered into an agreement with a third party
specifically commissioning the materials for use in teaching</div>
<div class="line">• such use is either agreed with the developer of the materials or
authorized in some other way</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Terms and conditions for university’s right of use:</div>
<div class="line">• The right of use shall not extend any further than can be justified
by the university based on the university’s mandates</div>
<div class="line">• The right of use shall not obstruct the employee’s own right of use</div>
<div class="line">• The employee shall have the right to be notified of any changes</div>
<div class="line">• The employee retains his/her ideal protection right (the right to be
credited by name)</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Computer programs</em></div>
<div class="line">The university has the right to computer software that is designed by
an employee through the work tasks that are encompassed by terms of
employment or under assignment from the university. The right shall
not extend any further than what can be justified as the university’s
primary tasks (research, teaching and dissemination of information).
Furthermore, the university’s right shall not obstruct the employee’s
own right of use, for example, the use of open software licences (open
source).</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Catalogues and databases</em></div>
<div class="line">The university has sole rights to use (copy, store, alter and publish)
catalogues and databases that have been created through substantial
investment on the part of the university. Execution of sole rights
shall not conflict with the principle of academic freedom or be a
hindrance to making catalogues and databases publicly accessible or
otherwise be placed at disposal for research purposes. For other
catalogues and databases, the sole rights belong to the employee who
produced them, unless</div>
<div class="line">• the university has specially asked an employee to develop these
catalogues or database</div>
<div class="line">• the university has entered into an agreement with a third party
specifically commissioning the materials</div>
<div class="line">• otherwise formally agreed</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Inventions</em></div>
<div class="line">The university can demand to take over commercial rights to the
employee’s patentable inventions, in whole or in part. The use of this
right shall not conflict with the principle of academic freedom. The
employee is free to prioritize publication, even if this may hinder
the opportunity to commercialize the invention. Any postponement for
the purpose of safeguarding the rights (for example, sending in the
application for a patent) can be agreed. An employee who develops and
invention must provide written notification to Bergen
Teknologioverføring AS (BTO), cf. Section 5, Norwegian Act Respecting
the Right to Employees’ Inventions. If there is a wish to make the
invention known to the public, this must be included in the
notification. Reference is also made to the section below pertaining
to General provisions concerning commercialization of research and
work results.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Physical materials</em></div>
<div class="line">Physical materials produced through the use of university resources
are the property of the university and can be freely used by the
university for teaching, research and commercial purposes. This does
not apply, however, if an agreement with a third party or other’s
rights stand in the way of this.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The person who has produced the material has</div>
<div class="line">• The right to access and use for his/her lifetime and has the right
to</div>
<div class="line">• Share the material with others (including outside the university)
under the following conditions:</div>
<div class="line">1. some of the material must remain at the university, that is, the
source cannot normally be deleted;</div>
<div class="line">2. the recipient shall not transfer the material to a third party
without the consent of the university;</div>
<div class="line">3. physical objects may only be shared with others for research
purposes; sharing for commercial purposes requires a separate
agreement;</div>
<div class="line">4. A signed agreement on the use of the shared material must be
obtained (the university’s template for Material Transfer Agreement)
from the recipient before the material is dispatched.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Administrative works</em></div>
<div class="line">The university has all rights to administrative work (such as
fact-finding reports, consultation statements, curriculum/syllabus
proposals and teaching plans).</div>
</div>
<p><strong>General provisions concerning commercialization of research and work
results</strong></p>
<p>Commercialization activities shall not conflict with the principle of
academic freedom. The employee is free to prioritize and opt making the
result known to the public even though this may conflict with
opportunities to commercialize. Bergen Teknologioverføring AS (BTO) is
the university’s commercialization agent and administrator in the
interests of the university, cf. agreement and decision of the
University Board nos.101/04 and 67/06 respectively.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">All employees are encouraged to contact BTO if they have concepts and
results that may have the potential for commercialization, cf.
www.bergento.no. Pursuant to the Employee Invention Act, employees
have a duty to report inventions; it is BTO that is the recipient of
such reports on behalf of the university. Pursuant to the Norwegian
Copyright Act, it may also be mandatory to report computer software
programs and databases. Examples of other results that can be reported
are physical objects as well as ideas with a potential to be
commercialized, along with results that can be copyrighted, such as
trademarks and designs.</div>
<div class="line">BTO will evaluate whether an effort is to be made to commercialize
results. The evaluation is done in dialogue with the employee. The
employee briefs his/her department head on the case in question when
the commercialization process begins.</div>
</div>
<p>The employee has a right to a reasonable share of the net revenue from a
successful commercialization. The benchmark for revenue sharing is
one-third to the employee, one-third to the university and one third to
the research environment in which the commercializable result was
achieved.</p>
<p>In the event the university does not exploit a research result or pursue
commercialization of it by a given deadline, the employee
himself/herself may exploit the result commercially by agreement with
the university.</p>
